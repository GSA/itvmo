description: "In April 2023, GAO reported that the goals and strategic
  objectives in the document provide a solid foundation for a comprehensive
  strategy. The strategy fully addressed three out of six desirable
  characteristics of a national strategy, but only partially addressed the other
  three. These include goals, resources, and organizational roles. ONCD plans to
  work with federal agencies to develop an implementation plan that includes
  milestones, performance measures, and budget priorities. "
synopsis: >-
  * It is crucial for these details to be issued promptly so agencies can start
  planning and allocating resources properly.

  * Without a clear roadmap for overcoming cyber challenges, the nation will lack guidance. GAO has designated ensuring cybersecurity as a high-risk issue because federal agencies and critical infrastructure rely on information systems.

  * The urgency to address these challenges led to the establishment of the Office of the National Cyber Director, responsible for developing and implementing a comprehensive national strategy.
