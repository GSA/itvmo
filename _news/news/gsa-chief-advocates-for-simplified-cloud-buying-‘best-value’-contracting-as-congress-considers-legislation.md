description: Robin Carnahan, head of the General Services Administration (GSA),
  is optimistic about legislative efforts to modernize federal procurement
  policies for cloud services and adopt a best value approach rather than
  prioritizing the lowest cost. Speaking at the Imagine Nation ELC 2024
  conference, she highlighted the Federal Improvement in Technology Procurement
  Act and the Value Over Cost Act, which aim to streamline procurement and
  enhance value. Both bills have passed the House Oversight Committee, but
  Congress faces a tight deadline to act before its term ends in January 2025.
synopsis: >-
  * Legislation for Modern Procurement: Two bills aim to update federal
  procurement policies for the digital age.

  * Cloud Services Subscription Model: The Federal Improvement in Technology Procurement Act promotes a subscription-based model for cloud services.

  * Best Value Over Lowest Cost: The Value Over Cost Act allows awarding contracts based on best value rather than the lowest cost.

  * Bipartisan Support: Both bills passed the House Oversight Committee unanimously.
