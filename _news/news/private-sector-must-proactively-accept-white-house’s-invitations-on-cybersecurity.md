description: "The National Cybersecurity Strategy from the White House is
  primarily intended for federal government officials. However, the latest
  release of the strategy includes commitments to the private sector on various
  cybersecurity issues. The President has invited the private sector to work
  alongside the government as partners, recognizing the importance of
  collaboration in securing cyberspace. "
synopsis: >-
  * Private sector organizations should accept this invitation, both
  individually and through trade organizations, but they must act quickly as
  there are limited seats available.

  * The federal government may need time to accept private sector officials as partners and build trust.

  * President Biden expects private sector involvement in a range of areas, including regulations, network and system protection, investigations, information sharing, incident response, liability for software vulnerabilities, workforce development, improving insurance products, preparing for post-quantum threats, and countering attempts by autocratic governments to control information technology.
