description: "On October 27, 2023, The Office of Management
and Budget (OMB)released a draft memorandum
aimed at modernizing the Federal Risk and
Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP),
inviting public comment on the proposal. Initially
established in 2011, FedRAMP was designed to
evaluate the security of commercial cloud services,
enabling federal agencies to leverage these services
efficiently and securely. However, the complexity
and diversity of today's cloud services have
outgrown the original framework of FedRAMP,
necessitating an update to address the current
cloud environment's challenges."
