description: Artificial intelligence is emerging as a top priority for federal
  chief data officers in 2023. A recent survey of federal CDOs found that AI has
  rapidly become one of their most important focus areas, second only to data
  quality management. Driving AI adoption is the vast potential of machine
  learning to glean insights from complex government datasets. However, federal
  AI development also faces barriers like skills gaps and biased algorithms. As
  stewards of data, CDOs are critical players in enabling ethical, responsible
  AI across agencies. Key recommendations for CDOs include auditing datasets for
  accuracy, considering algorithmic fairness, establishing AI review boards, and
  embracing transparency in capabilities. With more investment pouring into
  federal AI, CDO oversight must similarly intensify to instill public trust.
  Guiding sound data governance and AI best practices will allow agencies to tap
  the technologyâ€™s benefits while managing risks.
synopsis: >-
