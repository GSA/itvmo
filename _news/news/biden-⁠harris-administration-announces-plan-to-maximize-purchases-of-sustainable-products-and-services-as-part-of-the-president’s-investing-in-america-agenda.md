description: "The Biden-Harris Administration has announced a new plan to
  maximize the federal government's purchases of sustainable products and
  services. The plan directs federal agencies to reduce their carbon emissions
  and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. It calls for bold federal procurement
  policies to help create a market for carbon-free and sustainable materials. "
synopsis: >-
  * Specifically, agencies will need to transition to 100% carbon-pollution-free
  electricity by 2030, electrify their vehicle fleets, and purchase low carbon
  construction materials.

  * The plan also prioritizes buying American-made products to support domestic jobs.

  * According to the White House, the federal government spends over $650 billion per year on contracting, so this sustainable purchasing plan will help drive innovation while combating climate change.

  * Implementation will begin immediately with commitments across federal agencies.
