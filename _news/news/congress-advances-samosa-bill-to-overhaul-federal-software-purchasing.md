description: "The bipartisan legislation for consolidating US government
  software purchasing and giving agencies more control over software licensing
  has advanced in the House of Representatives. The Strengthening Agency
  Management and Oversight of Software Assets Act passed mark-up in the House
  Oversight Committee and will now be debated by lawmakers on the House floor. "
synopsis: >-
  * The SAMOSA legislation could have significant implications for US government
  software procurement, including centralized purchasing and independent audits
  of agency contracts with big tech companies.

  * Industry leaders and experts have both supported and criticized the proposed legislation, with some seeing it as a way to improve competition and reduce fees, while others believe it may limit product choices in an already consolidated market.

  * The bill moves forward amidst a broader discussion on how software is sold to government agencies by big tech companies and received unanimous approval in the committee mark-up vote.
