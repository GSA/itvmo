description: The U.S. Army is modernizing its software development processes,
  emphasizing agile methodologies and adapting its procurement strategies
  accordingly. A new directive promotes agile development, continuous
  collaboration between users and developers, and a flexible acquisition
  framework. The Army is working on a $1 billion, 10-year software contract,
  featuring an innovative indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity (IDIQ)
  structure with flexible contract types at the task order level. Industry
  feedback on this hybrid approach is mixed. Internally, the Army is
  transitioning to agile frameworks like SAFe, aiming to fully implement
  DevSecOps with automated processes.
