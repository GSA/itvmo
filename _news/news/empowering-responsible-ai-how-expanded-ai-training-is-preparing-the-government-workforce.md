description: Over the past decade, the government has embraced user-friendly
  technology to enhance digital services. The GSA’s AI Community of Practice
  partnered with OMB to offer the 2024 AI Training Series, expanding on the
  previous year’s success to train over 14,000 participants from nearly 200
  government organizations. The training emphasized responsible AI use and
  offered three specialized tracks—Acquisitions, Leadership and Policy, and
  Technical—delivered by leading academic institutions. Grounded in principles
  of AI safety, transparency, and trust, the program supports government
  employees in responsibly adopting AI to streamline services and optimize
  operations. Recordings are now available for broader access.
