  A new report from GSA sheds a new light on government tech accessibility,
  revealing that the government as a whole is failing to meet the minimum
  standard or legal obligation to provide equal access to all members of the
  public and federal employees with disabilities. The report focuses on federal
  compliance with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, which mandates that
  government technology be accessible to people with disabilities. Despite this
  requirement, the report finds that less than 30% of the most viewed intranet
  and internet pages, electronic documents, and videos are fully in line with
  Section 508 standards.


  The report, mandated as an annual exercise under the 2023 appropriations law, used self-reported data from 249 respondents across the government. It found that agencies with more mature Section 508 programs and more staff had more accessible tech. However, 38 reporting components reported having no Section 508 staff at all. The report recommends that Congress focus oversight efforts on major tech vendors to improve the accessibility of widely used software products and encourages agencies to use acquisition tools to incorporate accessibility requirements into procurement and contracting documents. It also suggests increased accessibility testing, mandatory training for relevant employees, and more internal agency oversight and leadership accountability on accessibility.
synopsis: >-
  * **Widespread Non-Compliance:** The government is not meeting its legal
  obligation to provide equal access to technology for people with disabilities.

  * **Low Conformance Rates:** Less than 30% of the most viewed pages and documents meet Section 508 standards, indicating ineffective accessibility policies and practices.

  * **Recommendations for Improvement:** The report suggests focusing on major tech vendors, incorporating accessibility requirements into procurement, increasing accessibility testing, and enhancing internal oversight and accountability.

  * **Data Quality Concerns:** Reporting officers expressed concerns about retribution for honest reporting and pressure to alter responses, leading to data quality issues.
