description: The White House Office of Management and Budget recently issued
  guidance to federal agencies on implementing President Biden's executive order
  on responsible artificial intelligence adoption. The guidelines provide a
  timeline for agencies to inventory their AI use cases, assess risks, and
  develop policies aligned with the order's principles for trustworthy and
  equitable AI. Agencies must submit plans detailing how they will minimize
  harmful bias, evaluate AI impacts on underserved communities, improve data
  quality, and continually monitor AI system performance. The guidance also
  establishes reporting requirements for agencies to update the public on their
  progress. While praising the administration's commitment to AI oversight, some
  industry observers caution against overregulation that stifles innovation.
  Others argue the guidelines lack enforcement mechanisms. As agencies move to
  transform the principles into practice, effective implementation will
  determine whether the order achieves its goals of ensuring AI safety,
  protecting civil rights, and building public trust.
