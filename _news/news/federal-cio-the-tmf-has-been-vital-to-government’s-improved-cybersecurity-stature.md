description: Federal CIO Clare Martorana highlighted the critical role of the
  Technology Modernization Fund (TMF) in advancing federal cybersecurity since
  the signing of Executive Order 14028 in 2021. With $935 million invested
  across 56 projects, primarily addressing cybersecurity, the TMF has helped
  agencies adopt zero trust, multi-factor authentication, and identity
  management. Despite its success, including an 80% project success rate
  compared to 13% for traditional IT acquisitions, Congress has been hesitant to
  sustain funding. Martorana and GSA head Robin Carnahan urged continued support
  for TMF, emphasizing its necessity for agile, timely investments in the face
  of evolving cyber threats.
