description: Artificial intelligence has the potential to be a powerful tool for
  federal cyber defenders given its ability to analyze vast amounts of data and
  detect malicious activity. However, many agencies lack the expertise to
  effectively implement and utilize AI. These AI tools have shown promising
  results in real-world applications, including detecting phishing emails with
  more subtle attack methods. Agencies must work to train existing employees on
  AI as well as recruit personnel with relevant skillsets. Adapting security
  frameworks and implementing machine learning best practices can also help
  validate and improve the effectiveness of AI cyber tools. Though barriers
  exist, collaboration across the government technology sector is critical to
  develop and deploy AI that enhances cyber defenders' abilities.
synopsis: >-
  * AI has proven capable of identifying sophisticated phishing attempts missed
  by legacy filters.

  * Adapting existing security frameworks can help validate and optimize AI-powered cyber tools.

  * Cross-agency collaboration is important for building AI models attuned to emerging threats.

  * Training programs and strategic hiring initiatives must target gaps in AI expertise.
