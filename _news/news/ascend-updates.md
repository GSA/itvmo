description: The General Services Administration (GSA) is addressing government
  cloud technology adoption challenges with the Ascend Blanket Purchase
  Agreement (BPA). This initiative aims to simplify cloud procurement and
  enhance security, compliance, and data management. Ascend will provide
  standardized, FedRAMP and Department of Defense-compliant cloud solutions,
  emphasizing cybersecurity, data ownership, and portability. Based on industry
  feedback, GSA adjusted requirements related to catalog management,
  cybersecurity logging, and FinOps monitoring, among others. The final
  solicitation for Ascend's first pool, covering Infrastructure as a Service
  (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS), is nearing completion.
