description: Federal experts advise that agencies should focus first on
  alleviating employee pain points as they start implementing AI systems in
  order to build trust. Employees are more likely to embrace AI if it helps
  their day-to-day work rather than complicates or disrupts it. Agencies should
  identify frustrating tasks that can be automated or streamlined using AI. They
  should also communicate clearly how AI will and won't be used, and train
  employees to work alongside AI systems. Building guardrails and testing for
  fairness and bias are also key in ensuring AI is trustworthy. Agencies are
  encouraged to start small with pilot projects and expand as they demonstrate
  benefits. Keeping humans involved and being transparent about AI will be
  critical for its acceptance.
