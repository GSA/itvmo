description: The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is
  planning to provide a list of software products deemed critical for federal
  government security by the end of September 2024. This initiative aims to
  address vulnerabilities in essential software used across various federal
  agencies and critical infrastructure, enhancing overall cybersecurity
  resilience. The focus is particularly on open source software (OSS), which is
  widely used within government systems and is integral to their operations.
  CISA's efforts involve engaging with the OSS community to understand and
  mitigate risks associated with its use, thereby securing a more resilient
  cyberspace ecosystem.

  * Identification of Critical Software: CISA will compile a list of software
  products that are vital for the security of federal agencies and critical
  infrastructure, focusing on open source software (OSS).

  * Engagement with OSS Community: The agency plans to work closely with the OSS community to better understand and secure the ecosystem, addressing risks associated with OSS usage in government operations.

  * Vulnerability and Risk Mitigation: CISA aims to reduce the risks to federal agencies by identifying vulnerabilities in widely used software and deploying measures to mitigate these risks.

  * Enhancing Cybersecurity Resilience: By securing critical software components, CISA intends to enhance the overall cybersecurity resilience of federal infrastructure.
