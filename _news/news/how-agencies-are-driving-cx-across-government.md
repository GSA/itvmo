description: Federal agencies are actively pursuing improvements in customer
  experience (CX) through digital transformation initiatives, notably in website
  modernization. A prime example is the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services
  (CMS), which achieved a significant increase in customer satisfaction with its
  Medicare.gov website, jumping from 56% to 72% in a year. This success is part
  of CMS's broader effort to enhance the Medicare enrollment process by
  exploring automatic enrollment options, thereby eliminating the need for
  manual form submissions. CMS aims to further its CX efforts by recruiting
  digitally savvy Gen Z employees, emphasizing the importance of fresh talent in
  driving innovation.
