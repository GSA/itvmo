description: "The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has
  unveiled a new plan to measure and improve the nation's cybersecurity posture.
  The CISA Metrics Plan aims to evaluate readiness, effectiveness, and
  accountability across the cyber ecosystem. It establishes 27 metrics across
  three goal areas - transforming the cyber ecosystem, strengthening the
  security of technology assets, and enabling operational resilience. "
synopsis: >-
  * Specific metrics track things like vulnerability disclosure rates, security
  control adoption, and incident response capabilities. CISA will collect data
  from partners in industry and all levels of government to inform the metrics.

  * The plan is part of CISA's ongoing effort to take a more data-driven approach to cybersecurity.

  * CISA director Easterly said metrics will help identify gaps, improve programs, and evaluate progress in managing cyber risk. The agency will update the metrics annually based on evolving threats and the cyber landscape.
