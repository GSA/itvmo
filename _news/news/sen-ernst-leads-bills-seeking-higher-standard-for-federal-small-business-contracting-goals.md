description: "The Ranking Member of the Senate Small Business Committee, Joni
  Ernst (R-Iowa), has introduced legislation to raise standards for federal
  small business contracting goals. The bill would require agencies to only
  include women-owned small businesses (WOSBs) and service-disabled
  veteran-owned small businesses (SDVOSBs) certified by the Small Business
  Administration in their governmentwide contracting targets. "
synopsis: >-
  * While agencies have consistently met or exceeded SDVOSB goals, they have
  only met WOSB goals in fiscal years 2019 and 2015. Under one of the bills
  introduced by Ernst, agencies that fail to meet their WOSB goals would be
  required to testify before the House and Senate small business committees. 

  * Another bill, the Accountability in Women-Owned Small Business Contracting Act, would only count prime and subcontract awards to SBA-certified WOSBs towards a governmentwide goal of 5% of federal contracting dollars going to WOSBs.

  * Additionally, the Stop Stolen Valor for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Contractors Act would prevent self-certified SDVOSBs from being included in the count towards a governmentwide goal of 3% of federal contracting dollars going to SDVOSBs.
