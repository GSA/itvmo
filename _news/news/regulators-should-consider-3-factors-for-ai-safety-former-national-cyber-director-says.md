  comprehensive approach to regulating artificial intelligence (AI), focusing on
  three main areas during a National Artificial Intelligence Advisory Committee
  meeting. He stressed the importance of understanding the purpose behind AI
  tools, ensuring there is a skilled workforce to manage them, and prioritizing
  human-centered design in AI development. Inglis's advice aims to ensure AI
  technologies are used responsibly and effectively, aligning with broader goals
  for ethical AI governance.
