description: The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is
  increasingly using artificial intelligence and machine learning to bolster
  cybersecurity efforts and protect federal networks. CISA sees AI as critical
  for automating threat detection and response as cyberattacks become more
  sophisticated. The agency is partnering with tech firms and academia to
  leverage AI, focusing on natural language processing to analyze threats in
  unstructured data. CISA is also using AI for network mapping and to identify
  vulnerabilities. The agency views AI as a force multiplier that allows them to
  do more with limited resources.
