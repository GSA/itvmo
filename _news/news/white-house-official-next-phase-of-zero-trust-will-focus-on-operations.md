description: The federal government is progressing well in its implementation of
  zero-trust architecture, with agencies meeting a recent deadline for
  foundational controls. According to acting federal Chief Information Security
  Officer (CISO) Mike Duffy, the next phase will focus on more complex aspects,
  such as leveraging technical controls for long-term technology transformation.
  While agencies have made significant progress, there are still challenges in
  fully resourcing the final mile of implementation. The focus now is on
  refining high-value assets, improving operations, and enhancing collaboration
  through shared services and lessons learned.
