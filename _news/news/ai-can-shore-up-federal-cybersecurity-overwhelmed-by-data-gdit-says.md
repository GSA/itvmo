description: General Dynamics Information Technology (GDIT) conducted a study on
  defensive cyber operations, revealing the potential of AI in bolstering
  federal cybersecurity. The study, based on a survey of 200 government leaders
  in national security, found that 41% are overwhelmed by data. AI is seen as
  valuable for real-time threat detection and automated countermeasures,
  addressing the significant issue of human error in cybersecurity. As hacking
  threats evolve, AI, automation, and pattern-recognizing tools are increasingly
  utilized for digital defense, particularly by the Department of Defense and
  other federal agencies.
