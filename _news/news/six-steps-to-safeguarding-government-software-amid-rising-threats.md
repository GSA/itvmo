description: "This outlines six steps federal agencies should take to better
  secure their software in light of escalating cyber threats. Software security
  needs to become a higher priority baked into development from the start. "
synopsis: >-
  * The first recommendation is prioritizing application security (AppSec) by
  hiring experts and conducting more robust testing.

  * Second is implementing DevSecOps to integrate security earlier in IT delivery pipelines.

  * Third is increased use of automated scans and testing tools to find vulnerabilities proactively.

  * Fourth is adopting a zero trust approach that assumes breach and limits damage.

  * Fifth is training developers more on secure coding practices.

  * Finally, rigorous pre-deployment testing should become standard. Implementing these six steps will bolster the government's ability to defend against sophisticated nation-state and criminal hackers trying to infiltrate agenciesâ€™ systems and data.
