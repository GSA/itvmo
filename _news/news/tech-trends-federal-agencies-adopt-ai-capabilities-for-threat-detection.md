description: Peter Dunn, CDW Government Federal CTO, emphasizes the potential of
  AI to enhance federal cybersecurity by handling repetitive tasks and detecting
  threats, but he highlights significant challenges. Agencies must first master
  data management to fully capitalize on AI's potential, particularly for threat
  response, as trust in automated actions remains limited. AI tools, like spam
  filters, improve efficiency, but agencies must invest in upskilling employees
  and fostering interagency collaboration to maximize AI's benefits. Interagency
  efforts, including the synchronization of AI leadership roles, can address
  fragmented implementations and ensure cohesive AI adoption across the federal
  government.
