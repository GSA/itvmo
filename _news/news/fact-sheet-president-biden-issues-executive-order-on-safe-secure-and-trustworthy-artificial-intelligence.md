  that federal agencies must follow when adopting AI systems. It directs
  agencies to assess AI risks, minimize harmful bias, ensure high standards of
  data quality, and regularly test systems for safety and security
  vulnerabilities. The order also creates an AI Bill of Rights that protects
  citizens' civil liberties and sets limits on how their data can be used by AI
  systems. To oversee implementation, the order establishes a National AI
  Advisory Committee comprising government, private sector, academic and civil
