description: "Kalpana Kotagal was confirmed as a commissioner to the EEOC on
  July 13, 2023. This confirmation renews the focus on EEOC priorities, one of
  which is the pay data collection program through the EEO-1. "
synopsis: >-
  * Pay data collection is crucial for achieving pay equity. It provides
  enforcement agencies, such as the EEOC, OFCCP, and state labor departments,
  with better data to enforce civil rights laws and encourages employers to
  analyze their pay practices and address disparities.

  * By collecting pay data through the EEO-1, the EEOC and OFCCP can effectively target pay discrimination and occupational segregation in specific firms, industries, and localities.

  * This issue briefly outlines the key aspects of pay data collection through the EEO-1 and suggests improvements for future implementation.
