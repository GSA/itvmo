  two platforms to enhance equity in procurement for federal agencies. These
  tools, launched earlier this spring, aim to assist agencies in finding new
  businesses for federal contracts, identifying qualified vendors, and
  monitoring progress towards equity goals.
synopsis: >-
  * The Biden Administration has set a goal of 15% federal contract spend for
  small disadvantaged businesses by 2025, while the Office of Management and
  Budget (OMB) has set a target of 12% for fiscal 2023.

  * GSA Administrator Robin Carnahan emphasized that these tools will enable agencies to connect with a diverse range of businesses in the federal marketplace, promoting equity and achieving contracting goals.
