description: Federal agencies have begun posting their compliance plans in
  response to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) memo M-24-10, which
  outlines AI governance requirements. These plans detail how agencies will
  update internal policies, manage AI risk, create AI use case inventories, and
  assess whether AI uses impact rights or safety. Agencies were required to
  publish their initial plans or indicate they donâ€™t use AI by the deadline, and
  these will be updated every two years until 2036. With several upcoming
  deadlines, agencies are also expected to address extensions and publish
  updated inventories in the coming months.
