description: The Department of State, through a partnership between three
  offices, is leveraging AI to streamline the declassification process of
  25-year-old classified documents, addressing the growing volume of electronic
  records that require review. The pilot project successfully trained a model
  using previous declassification decisions, achieving a 97% accuracy rate and
  reducing the manual workload by over 65%. This AI-assisted approach will not
  replace jobs but will work alongside human reviewers to ensure accuracy and
  adapt to changing contexts. The initiative is expected to save millions of
  dollars in labor costs and serve as a model for future AI applications in
  government.
synopsis: >-
  * AI for Declassification: The State Department is using AI to automate the
  review of classified documents, significantly reducing manual effort.

  * High Accuracy: The pilot achieved a 97% match with human decisions, showing AI's effectiveness in this role.

  * Cost Savings: The initiative could save up to $8 million in labor costs over the next decade.

  * Human-AI Collaboration: AI assists rather than replaces human reviewers, ensuring continued oversight and adaptability.

  * Broader Implications: The project highlights how AI can enhance government efficiency and transparency, with potential applications across other federal programs.
