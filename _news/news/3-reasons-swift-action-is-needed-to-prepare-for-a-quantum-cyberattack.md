description: "Swift action is needed to prepare for potential quantum
  cyberattacks that could threaten national security. With quantum computing
  advances, current encryption methods face risks. Three reasons urgent action
  is required: quantum-safe encryption standards must be developed, agencies
  need support transitioning systems to new standards before attacks occur, and
  increased investment is critical for quantum-safe R&D and workforce
  development. The author believes policymakers need to make quantum-safe
  encryption a national priority and provides recommendations like establishing
  a coordinated federal strategy on quantum-safe security."
synopsis: >-
  * Quantum computing advances mean cyberattacks could soon break current
  encryption.

  * Urgent action needed to prepare critical systems for "quantum apocalypse".

  * Reason 1: Develop new quantum-safe encryption standards.

  * Reason 2: Help agencies transition systems to new standards preemptively.

  * Reason 3: Prioritize investments in quantum-safe R&D and workforce.
