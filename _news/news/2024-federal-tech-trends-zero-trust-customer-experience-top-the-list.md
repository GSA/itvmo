description: The 2024 federal technology trends are heavily influenced by
  executive orders focusing on zero-trust security and enhancing citizens'
  digital experience with government services. Agencies are gearing up to meet
  the zero-trust deadlines and are looking forward to measuring their progress
  towards the customer experience goals set by the 21st Century Integrated
  Digital Experience Act (21st Century IDEA). The move towards zero-trust
  security is a top priority, with a significant percentage of agencies
  confident in meeting the requirements. However, challenges remain, and there's
  a call for improved engagement between the federal government and private
  industry to navigate these complex initiatives. Additionally, the federal
  government is making strides in customer experience projects, taking a
  human-centered approach to service delivery. Other key concerns for 2024
  include data management, cybersecurity, and workforce issues, with a focus on
  system interoperability, common data standards, and the need for a more robust
  understanding of data and analytics.
