description: The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) report highlights
  that federal agencies have made progress in cybersecurity, particularly in
  incident response, but still need to fully implement specific requirements.
  Despite advancements in handling cyber incidents, gaps remain in event
  logging, a key aspect for managing cybersecurity incidents effectively. The
  GAO stresses the importance of complete adherence to these requirements to
  enhance the detection, investigation, and remediation of cyber threats.
