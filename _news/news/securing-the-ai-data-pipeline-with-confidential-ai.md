description: Federal agencies face growing regulatory pressure to secure AI
  technologies amidst evolving requirements like the Executive Order on AI and
  NIST's AI Safety Institute Consortium. Confidential AI offers a solution by
  enhancing security, privacy, and compliance through tailored protections for
  data and models across the AI pipeline. This involves encryption,
  authentication, and cryptographic attestation to ensure sensitive information
  and proprietary algorithms remain secure. From classified defense projects to
  healthcare initiatives using synthetic data, confidential AI enables federal
  agencies to harness the benefits of AI while addressing security challenges in
  their most sensitive use cases.
synopsis: >-
  * Regulatory Pressures: Agencies must comply with regulations ensuring AI
  security and safety, such as the Executive Order on AI and NIST guidelines.

  * Risks of Generative AI (GenAI): AI introduces risks of exposing sensitive data and intellectual property, particularly in highly classified or regulated environments.

  * Confidential AI Protections: Techniques like encryption, authentication, and cryptographic attestation create a secure AI environment for data at rest, in transit, and in use.

  * Applications Across Sectors: Confidential AI supports demanding use cases, including defense projects, disease modeling with synthetic data, and emergency response systems.

  * Operational Benefits: By safeguarding AI pipelines, confidential AI enhances mission outcomes, ensures compliance, and supports advanced AI-driven citizen services.
