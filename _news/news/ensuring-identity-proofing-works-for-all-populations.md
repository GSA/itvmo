description: The increasing need for delivering public services quickly,
  accurately, and securely has led federal, state, and local government agencies
  to turn to modern and scalable platforms for identity verification. Dan Lopez,
  GSAâ€™s director for Login.gov, emphasized that the platform, serving over 80
  million user accounts across more than 40 agencies, must ensure accessibility
  and security for all, including those with disabilities or digital challenges.
  The goal is to serve all members of the public while respecting privacy,
  mitigating fraud, and preserving the integrity of government systems, despite
  the challenges of reaching the full American public due to disparities in
  access to facilities, technologies, and support. Success stories include
  Login.gov's facilitation of secure access to unemployment insurance benefits
  during the Maui wildfires.
