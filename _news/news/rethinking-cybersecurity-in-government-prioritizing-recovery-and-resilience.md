description: Despite significant investments in cybersecurity, cyberattacks on
  government IT systems are rising, exposing the limitations of
  prevention-focused strategies. Agencies must prioritize cyber recovery,
  recognizing breaches as inevitable and focusing on rapid, effective recovery
  to minimize impact. Current recovery infrastructures, often outdated and
  vulnerable, need upgrades like integrated backup and storage solutions with
  built-in security features. Innovations like Rubrik Security Cloud â€“
  Government offer immutability, air-gapping, and zero-trust capabilities,
  enabling faster recovery and malware-free backups. Consolidating recovery
  tools can reduce costs, simplify operations, and enhance resilience, making
  cyber recovery a critical element of modern cybersecurity strategies.
synopsis: >-
  * Cyberattack sophistication necessitates shifting focus from prevention to
  recovery.

  * Traditional recovery systems are outdated and vulnerable, often targeted in over 90% of attacks.

  * Solutions like Rubrik Security Cloud integrate backup and security to ensure fast, secure recovery.

  * Consolidating recovery tools reduces complexity and costs while improving resilience.

  * Cyber recovery is essential for minimizing downtime and ensuring mission-critical data integrity.
