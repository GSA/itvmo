description: "The GAO identifies four primary challenges in federal
  cybersecurity: the National Cybersecurity Strategy needs stronger performance
  measures; federal agencies face difficulties in securing systems due to
  ineffective controls and unaddressed vulnerabilities; critical infrastructure
  sectors are vulnerable to attacks with ongoing federal protection
  shortcomings; and efforts to protect personal privacy are insufficient,
  lacking comprehensive laws. These issues highlight the urgent need for
  improved measures to defend against increasing cyber threats."
synopsis: |-
  * National Cybersecurity Strategy needs stronger performance measures.
  * Agencies struggle with securing federal systems.
  * Critical infrastructure remains vulnerable to attacks.
  * Personal privacy protection efforts are insufficient.
