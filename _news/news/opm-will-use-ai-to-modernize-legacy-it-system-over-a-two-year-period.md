description: The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) will utilize artificial
  intelligence (AI) as part of a Technology Modernization Fund (TMF) award to
  update its legacy retirement system. The project will rehost legacy systems in
  the cloud and use AI to rewrite COBOL code, significantly accelerating
  modernization compared to traditional methods. The initiative, which is
  expected to take two years, aims to improve system transparency, usability,
  and efficiency. While AI will handle code rewriting, human developers will
  ensure quality control. The project is part of OPMâ€™s broader modernization
  roadmap, informed by extensive analysis of legacy systems and millions of
  lines of code.
synopsis: >-
  * Modernization Goal: Update OPM's retirement systems for improved
  transparency, efficiency, and user-friendliness through TMF funding.

  * AI-Driven Approach: Use generative AI to rewrite COBOL code, significantly reducing development time from five years to two.

  * Cloud Transition: Legacy systems will be rehosted in the cloud as part of the project.

  * Human Oversight: Developers, testers, and quality control staff will validate AI-rewritten code.

  * Extensive Preparation: Analysis of millions of lines of legacy code informed the decision to leverage AI for modernization.
