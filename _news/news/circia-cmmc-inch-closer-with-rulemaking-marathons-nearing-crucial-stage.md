description: "The Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) effort is
  nearing a crucial stage as it works to finalize cybersecurity regulations for
  defense contractors. CMMC establishes required security standards and
  certifies contractors across 5 levels based on the sensitivity of information
  they handle. "
synopsis: >-
  * After announcing a strategic pause and overhaul last year, the CMMC program
  has been working aggressively to publish a draft regulation by early 2023.

  * The team has held "rulemaking marathons" to make rapid progress. Once published, industry will have opportunities to offer feedback during the rulemaking process before finalization.

  * Some areas still being refined include the role of the CMMC accreditation body and ensuring reciprocity across vendors.

  * While challenges remain, leaders feel CMMC 2.0 will significantly improve cyber hygiene across the 300,000 member defense industrial base when implemented. A mature CMMC ecosystem is critical to safeguarding sensitive data and weapons systems.
