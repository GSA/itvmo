description: Government agencies are turning to the private sector for guidance
  on artificial intelligence (AI), but they face unique challenges compared to
  businesses. While private sector mistakes may result in profit loss or
  unsatisfied customers, AI failures in the public sector could disrupt critical
  services, even affecting lives. Thus, government agencies approach AI more
  cautiously, often exploring low-risk internal applications before scaling up.
  Though there are opportunities, agencies must address challenges like ethics,
  data management, and infrastructure. AI, particularly generative AI (GenAI),
  can enhance back-office processes but will not replace employees, only augment
  their productivity.
synopsis: >-
  * Government AI mistakes carry higher risks compared to the private sector.

  * Agencies are encouraged to begin with internal, low-risk AI applications.

  * AI can automate back-office tasks, improving efficiency without replacing employees.

  * Ethical concerns, data organization, and infrastructure gaps are major challenges.

  * Effective data management is crucial for leveraging AI in public services.
