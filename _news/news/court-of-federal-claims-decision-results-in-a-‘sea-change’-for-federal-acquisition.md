description: "The Court of Federal Claims made a decision that affected two
  major governmentwide acquisition contracts from the General Services
  Administration. This decision also disrupted almost five years of effort to
  change the culture of federal contracting. Tiffany Hixson, the assistant
  commissioner for the Office of Professional Services and Human Capital
  Categories in the GSA's Federal Acquisition Service, stated that the decision
  will impact the approach to OASIS+'s acquisition strategy. "
synopsis: >-
  * Originally, price was not going to be considered as an evaluation factor in
  the RFP, but based on the judge's decision, there will be a pivot.

  * The Court's decision not only delays the release of the OASIS+ final solicitation and awards under Polaris but also hinders the efforts to change the evaluation and award process for GWACs and multiple award contracts.

  * The Court ruled that GSA applied the Section 876 statute too broadly in Polaris, stating that price was not necessary as an evaluation factor. GSA allowed agencies to award task orders under Polaris with different contract types, but with a preference for firm fixed price contracts.
