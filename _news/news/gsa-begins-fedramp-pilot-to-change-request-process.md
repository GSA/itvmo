description: The General Services Administration (GSA) has announced a new
  FedRAMP pilot program utilizing a non-blocking process to review significant
  changes to the governmentwide compliance program for cloud services. The Agile
  Delivery pilot aims to replace the current significant change request process
  with a more streamlined approach, removing the need for advanced approval for
  each change. Cloud service providers are invited to apply, with the GSA
  emphasizing the importance of continuous assessment rather than point-in-time
  evaluations to enhance security and efficiency.
synopsis: >-
  * Non-Blocking Process: The pilot will remove the requirement for advanced
  approval for each change, allowing cloud service providers to move through the
  process more smoothly.

  * Focus on New Features: The pilot will concentrate on adding new features to existing cloud service offerings, addressing a significant pain point in the current FedRAMP process.

  * Application and Timeline: Applications are open until July 26, with selections expected by August 16. Providers planning to release new features by the end of the year are encouraged to apply.

  * Continuous Assessment: The long-term goal is to shift towards a continuous assessment model, ensuring ongoing confidence in security without the delays associated with the current process.

  * Stakeholder Impact: The pilot may initially result in delays for agencies, and cloud providers might create government-specific offerings that lag behind commercial ones to avoid development delays.
