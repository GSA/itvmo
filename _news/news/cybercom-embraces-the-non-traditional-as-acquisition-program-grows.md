description: U.S. Cyber Command (CYBERCOM) is expanding its acquisition team and
  adopting flexible buying strategies to become the Defense Department's hub for
  cyber procurement. Initially granted limited acquisition authority in 2016,
  CYBERCOM has seen these limits lifted by Congress, allowing for increased
  spending and staffing. The command now enjoys the status of a federal
  laboratory, enhancing its collaboration with industry and academia, and
  providing greater control over budgetary decisions for cyber programs.
  CYBERCOM aims to streamline cyber acquisitions, moving away from traditional
  DoD processes to accommodate the rapid pace of cybersecurity needs.
