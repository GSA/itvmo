description: "Small technology companies recently asked Congress to implement
  changes to make government acquisition more navigable for new vendors. In a
  letter, founders of younger tech firms argued current acquisition practices
  favor larger, traditional government contractors and create barriers for new
  entrants. They cited issues like overly complex proposal requirements,
  restrictive classification rules, and lack of transparency around needs. "
synopsis: >-
  * The founders urged Congress to mandate more modular contracting, force
  agencies to work with new suppliers, and invest more in acquisition workforce
  training.

  * Other recommendations included providing incentives to incumbent contractors that partner with innovative startups and subsidizing pilot contracts for new solutions.

  * The technologists said that reforming acquisition is vital to tapping into emerging technologies from commercial companies and keeping up with innovations used by adversaries.

  * Opening government procurement to new players will also increase competition and reduce costs.
