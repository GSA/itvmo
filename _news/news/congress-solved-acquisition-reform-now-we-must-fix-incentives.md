description: The Department of Defense has challenges. Acquisition reform is
  needed. Congress has instituted rules for the DoD to follow for procurement.
  However, the DoD still struggles to rapidly deliver technology from science
  and technology to programs of record. Many innovations are stuck in research
  and development and never reach the warfighter.
synopsis: >-
  * There are two reasons for this lack of progress. First, collaboration
  between the S&T community, program executive offices, and tech companies needs
  improvement. Collaboration is crucial to accelerate the deployment of defense
  capabilities.

  * Second, institutional incentives need to align with fast-tracking technology to warfighters.\
    Currently, the DoD doesn't provide enough incentives for transitioning from research and development to procurement.
  * There are also too many innovation offices without ties to programs and program executive offices. The DoD should reduce or remove these offices and focus on those that work.
