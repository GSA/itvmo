description: The Governmentwide Microsoft Acquisition Strategy (GMAS) is a
  groundbreaking initiative by the IT Vendor Management Office (ITVMO) to
  standardize contract terms and pricing for Microsoft products across federal
  agencies. Launched under the Better Contracting Initiative (BCI), GMAS seeks
  to consolidate best-in-class terms into a universal framework, ensuring
  agencies benefit from collective efficiencies, cost savings, and enhanced
  cybersecurity. The effort, involving comprehensive analysis and collaboration
  with Microsoft and federal stakeholders, aims to position the government as a
  unified customer. Following GMAS, ITVMO plans to extend similar strategies to
  other major IT Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) in fiscal year 2025.
