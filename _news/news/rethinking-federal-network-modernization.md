description: Federal agencies must modernize their networks to support AI-driven
  operations, data-centric services, and edge computing. Legacy networks
  struggle to handle increasing data demands and the growing number of connected
  devices. Modernized networks are critical for cybersecurity and AI adoption.
  However, challenges remain in aligning procurement, budgets, and
  infrastructure upgrades to meet mission-critical demands effectively.
synopsis: >-
  * Data Challenges: Agencies struggle with legacy networks that can’t manage
  massive data volumes or support modern AI-driven workloads.

  * Edge Computing Focus: Shifting AI and data processing to the edge reduces latency, improves bandwidth, and streamlines operations.

  * Open Networking: Non-proprietary, interoperable solutions enhance scalability, cost-efficiency, and innovation.

  * Modernization for AI & Cybersecurity: Upgraded networks are essential for robust cybersecurity and maximizing AI’s potential.
