description: The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has
  updated its requirements for protecting controlled unclassified information
  (CUI). The revised guidelines aim to modernize security controls for CUI
  systems based on emerging technologies and new cyber threats. Key updates
  include additional multifactor authentication methods, improving identity and
  access management, enhanced logging and monitoring capabilities, and
  integrating security into system development processes. The guidelines also
  provide scalable baseline security requirements that can be tailored based on
  an organization's risk management strategy. Adopting the guidelines will be
  mandatory for federal agencies and contractors handling CUI. NIST developed
  the updates with input from public and private sector stakeholders.
  Implementing the guidelines will improve real-time detection of cyber
  incidents and unauthorized access attempts across CUI systems. Overall, the
  changes seek to bring CUI cybersecurity policies in line with today's digital
  environment.
