description: The General Services Administration (GSA) welcomed 70 new fellows
  to the U.S. Digital Corps (USDC), marking the largest cohort since the
  program's inception. This year, 2,000 applicants competed for the two-year
  paid fellowship, which offers early-career technologists opportunities to work
  in areas like AI, cybersecurity, data science, and software engineering across
  federal agencies. The majority of this cohort will focus on AI projects,
  aligning with the Biden-Harris administration’s push to enhance AI talent in
  government. The GSA aims to scale the program further, building on a
  successful inaugural class with high retention rates.
