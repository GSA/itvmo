description: The Technology Modernization Fund (TMF) is driving the adoption of
  zero trust architecture across federal agencies, emphasizing enhanced
  cybersecurity in the face of growing cyber threats and a more distributed
  workforce. Zero trust operates on the principle that no user or device is
  inherently trusted, requiring continuous authentication and authorization for
  access. TMF's financial support, such as the $20 million for the Department of
  Educationâ€™s zero-trust project, is crucial in overcoming resource and
  technical challenges, leading to a more secure federal IT infrastructure.
synopsis: >-
  * Zero Trust Overview: No default trust; every access request must be
  authenticated and authorized.

  * TMF Support: Provides financial and technical resources for agencies to implement zero trust.

  * Examples: Two-factor authentication and biometric identification are common zero trust practices.

  * Department of Education Project: $20 million TMF investment for secure student aid services.

  * Future Impact: TMF's investment fosters a more secure and resilient federal IT landscape.
