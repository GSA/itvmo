description: The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has
  issued a binding directive requiring federal agencies to adhere to cloud
  security standards under the Secure Cloud Business Applications (SCuBA)
  project. This directive, prompted by lessons from the 2020 SolarWinds Orion
  hack, aims to enhance federal cloud security and reduce vulnerabilities to
  cyberattacks. Agencies must meet reporting, monitoring, and compliance
  deadlines between February and June 2025. Although the directive applies to
  federal civilian agencies, CISA encourages all organizations to adopt the
  guidance to bolster cloud security across sectors.
synopsis: >-
  * SCuBA Standards: Federal agencies must comply with cloud security standards
  outlined by the SCuBA project.

  * Motivations: The directive stems from the SolarWinds Orion incident and broader concerns about cloud vulnerabilities.

  * Scope: While focused on federal civilian agencies, CISA urges organizations across all sectors to adopt these cloud security measures.

  * Toolkits: Microsoft and Google provide SCuBA developer toolkits to support implementation.
