description: The White House has successfully met all 90-day benchmarks set in
  President Joe Biden's Executive Order on artificial intelligence, focusing on
  managing AI-related security risks and fostering innovation. Key actions
  include obliging AI software developers to report crucial system information,
  such as safety test results, to the Department of Commerce. Additionally, a
  new rule proposal requires U.S. cloud companies to disclose foreign clients
  using cloud software for training powerful AI models. Nine agencies have
  submitted AI system risk assessments to the Department of Homeland Security,
  laying the groundwork for ongoing federal action. The National Science
  Foundation launched the National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource
  pilot, democratizing access to AI tools. Moreover, increased hiring for
  AI-focused positions in the federal government is underway, with some agencies
  delivering on their mandated actions ahead of schedule.
