description: Federal officials stress the urgent need for congressional funding
  of workforce development programs to equip employees with skills, particularly
  in AI, to meet emerging challenges. During a panel at SAPâ€™s Federal Forum, IRS
  and Commerce Department leaders highlighted the critical role of training,
  often sidelined during budget cuts, and emphasized the importance of AI
  education for current employees. The federal shift towards skills-based
  hiring, prioritizing competencies over formal education, is expected to
  continue, recognizing diverse skill acquisition through trade schools,
  military experience, and apprenticeships.
