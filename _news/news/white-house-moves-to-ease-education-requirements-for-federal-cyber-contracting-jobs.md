  National Cyber Director Harry Coker is actively working to broaden the pool of
  cybersecurity professionals within the federal government by advocating for
  reduced educational requirements for certain contracting roles. This
  initiative, in collaboration with OMB, is part of a broader effort by the
  Biden administration to address the significant shortage in the cybersecurity
  workforce and to promote diversity in the field. By eliminating the four-year
  degree requirement, the administration aims to make cybersecurity roles more
  accessible and inclusive, especially for women and people of color who have
  been historically underrepresented.


  Coker emphasized the importance of inclusivity in defending digital systems, a critical component of modern infrastructure. To this end, his office plans to implement hiring sprints and recruitment events, particularly targeting locations that have been overlooked by federal recruitment efforts. The urgency of these efforts is underscored by Coker's estimate of at least half a million vacant cybersecurity positions in the industry, a gap that poses a risk at a time when digital systems are increasingly under threat. The Biden administration views this push not only as a security imperative but also as a means to drive economic development and ensure equitable participation in the benefits of the digital revolution.
synopsis: >-
  * **Reducing Educational Barriers:** Coker is collaborating with the Office of
  Management and Budget to remove the four-year degree requirement for some
  federal cybersecurity contracting positions. This effort aims to make
  cybersecurity jobs more accessible and increase diversity within the field.

  * **Promoting Diversity and Inclusivity:** The initiative focuses on opening pathways to cybersecurity careers for groups traditionally underrepresented in the field, such as women and people of color, by eliminating historical barriers to entry.

  * **Utilizing Community Colleges:** Institutions like the Community College of Baltimore County, recognized for excellence in cybersecurity education, are seen as crucial for providing affordable and accessible technical training to help fill the vast number of open positions.

  * **Addressing the Workforce Shortage:** With an estimated half a million open cybersecurity positions, the initiative recognizes the urgent need to secure digital systems against increasing threats and aims to rapidly fill these vacancies.
