description: A coalition of federal affinity groups is advocating for greater
  diversity within the Senior Executive Service (SES) ranks across government.
  In letters to the Office of Management and Budget and Office of Personnel
  Management, the groups argue the SES lacks representation and inclusion,
  especially for women and people of color. They say enhancing SES diversity
  will improve decision making and service delivery.
synopsis: >-
  * The groups made several recommendations including setting diversity goals,
  expanding mentorship and career development programs, and improving exit
  survey data collection to identify gaps.

  * They also highlighted the need for more diverse SES selection panels and interview questions targeting critical competencies.

  * The letters underscore ongoing efforts to ensure the federal leadership that shapes policies and programs reflects the diversity of America.
