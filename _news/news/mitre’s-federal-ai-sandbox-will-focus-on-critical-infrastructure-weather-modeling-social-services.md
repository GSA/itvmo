description: MITRE announced plans to train three new AI foundation models
  focused on critical infrastructure, weather modeling, and sustainable social
  services using its Federal AI Sandbox, a supercomputer designed for
  large-scale AI model training. This AI initiative aims to enhance
  cybersecurity, improve weather predictions, and streamline government
  workflows. Agencies can access the sandbox through existing MITRE contracts,
  with the sandbox expected to be available by the end of 2024. The White House
  emphasizes the importance of strong federal R&D funding to ensure the success
  of AI and other transformative technologies in addressing national challenges.
