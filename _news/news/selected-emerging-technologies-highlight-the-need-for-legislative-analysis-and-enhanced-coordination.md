description: The Government Accountability Office (GAO) report highlights the
  challenges and opportunities faced by federal agencies in regulating emerging
  technologies like drones, AI-enabled medical devices, and others. The
  Department of Transportation (DOT), Federal Communications Commission (FCC),
  and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reported using various practices to
  address these challenges. However, the FDA indicated the need for updated
  authorities to better regulate AI-enabled medical devices. The report
  emphasizes the importance of interagency collaboration and knowledge-building
  efforts, noting that foreign regulators have more extensive outreach,
  especially with industry and academia. The GAO made three recommendations to
  improve ongoing efforts, including documenting potential legislative changes,
  providing public information on collaborative efforts, and publicizing
  industry-facing initiatives.
