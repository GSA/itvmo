description: "The Federal Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) recently
  discussed how new cybersecurity metrics are helping improve the federal
  government's risk posture. The CISO office has been working with agencies to
  develop data-driven metrics to better understand cyber vulnerabilities and
  threats. Some examples include measuring patch management, multifactor
  authentication implementation, and exposure of high value assets. "
synopsis: >-
  * The CISO said this metrics-based approach moves cybersecurity discussions
  from theoretical to data-driven decisions. It also provides greater visibility
  across the entire federal enterprise to combat threats.

  * The office is looking into further metrics like cyber workforce readiness and supply chain risks.

  * Overall, leveraging metrics helps focus limited cybersecurity resources on the most critical risks facing federal systems and data.
