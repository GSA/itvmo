description: "The House Oversight and Reform Committee recently passed several
  bills aimed at improving efficiency and reducing waste, fraud, and abuse in
  the federal government. One bill would require agencies to conduct inventories
  and reduce excess property, which could save billions in storage and
  maintenance costs. Another bill would improve the management of government
  purchase cards to prevent misuse. "
