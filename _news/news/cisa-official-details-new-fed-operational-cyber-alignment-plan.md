description: The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has
  introduced the Federal Operational Cyber Alignment Plan (FOCAL) to enhance
  cybersecurity coordination across the Federal government. This initiative, as
  explained by CISA Associate Director Michael Duffy, aims to unify the
  cybersecurity efforts of Federal agencies by setting clear, achievable
  targets. The plan was developed in response to the evolving threat environment
  and the growing list of cybersecurity tasks agencies face. FOCAL is designed
  to not only streamline efforts but also to leverage existing programs like the
  Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM) program for better defense and
  communication among agencies. This shift represents a significant change in
  CISA's approach, moving from merely providing information and guidance to
  offering capabilities that alleviate the cybersecurity burden on agencies,
  thereby improving operational visibility and threat information sharing.
