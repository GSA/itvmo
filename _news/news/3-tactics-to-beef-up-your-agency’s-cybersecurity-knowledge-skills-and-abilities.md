description: "Cybersecurity in government is getting tougher as cyber criminals
  and adversaries increase their attacks. Previously, only advanced individuals
  could execute low-level attacks, but now criminals can simply copy, paste, and
  press enter. These attacks are fueled by the potential financial gain from
  breaching large organizations with valuable data. "
synopsis: >-
  * The cost to organizations is growing exponentially and is projected to reach
  $13 trillion in losses worldwide in the next few years.

  * While it may be easier for cyber criminals to attack systems, defending against them and removing them from federal systems requires a sophisticated effort.

  * Cyberattacks are asymmetric, meaning a small, highly motivated group can have the same impact as a well-resourced group. The government needs to respond effectively.

  * Three tactics agencies can employ are improving the cyber knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) of their security and technology teams, as well as their employees.
