description: A new bill introduced in Congress aims to establish the National
  Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) AI risk management framework as
  the baseline for federal procurement of artificial intelligence systems. The
  Artificial Intelligence Procurement Act would mandate agencies to adopt NIST's
  voluntary guidance on identifying, assessing and mitigating risks when
  acquiring AI tools. This framework provides a methodology to evaluate factors
  like data quality, system security, and potential biases. Codifying these best
  practices into law would provide consistent standards for trustworthy AI
  across government. However, some opponents argue NIST's framework is too rigid
  for the dynamic evolution of AI. If passed, the bill would grant NIST
  statutory authority to update the framework with stakeholder input. Proponents
  believe regulating AI procurement is an important step toward responsible AI
  adoption. Critics contend it could hamper innovation and ignore the unique
  needs of individual agencies. Further debate is expected on balancing AI
  progress and prudence.
synopsis: >-
  * New bill would codify NIST's AI risk management framework for procurement.

  * NIST framework offers methodology to assess AI risks like biases and security flaws.

  * Would standardize trustworthy AI practices across federal government.

  * Balances twin goals of spurring AI innovation while managing potential downsides.
