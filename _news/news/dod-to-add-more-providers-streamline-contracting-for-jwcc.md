description: The Defense Department (DoD) is advancing the Joint Warfighting
  Cloud Capability (JWCC) initiative by streamlining contracting processes and
  incorporating more cloud service providers. Over $1 billion in task orders
  have been issued under JWCC, with the potential for the contract to reach $9
  billion over 10 years. The DoD is now preparing for the next phase by
  identifying new requirements and learning from past experiences with previous
  contracts like the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI). The
  contract supports various missions, including the Combined Joint All Domain
  Command and Control (CJADC2), with an average task order lead time of 25 days.
