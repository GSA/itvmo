description: The power of AI to address critical challenges like disaster
  response, pandemics, and national security underscores the need for a strong
  federal data and AI workforce. Despite some progress, such as the hiring of
  over 200 AI experts under the 2023 AI Executive Order, the government still
  lacks a formalized data and AI workforce. Federal chief digital and artificial
  intelligence officers (CDAOs) and chief data officers (CDOs) must lead efforts
  to create career pathways, embed AI expertise across agencies, and
  institutionalize progress through policies and strategies. Building a
  world-class AI workforce is essential for national prosperity and security.
synopsis: >-
  * AI Talent Surge: Over 200 AI experts were hired through federal programs
  like the U.S. Digital Service and Presidential Innovation Fellowship under the
  2023 AI Executive Order.

  * Career Pathways: Formalizing AI professions and creating structured career paths is essential for workforce retention and sustainable growth.

  * Agency Integration: All agencies must embrace data and AI expertise as core skills, with partnerships to promote adoption and reduce reliance on contractors.

  * Institutional Frameworks: Pilots and task forces must transition into permanent policies and strategies to align resources, accountability, and incentives.

  * Community Building: Establishing a centralized platform for AI professionals can foster innovation, collaboration, and recognition across the federal workforce.
