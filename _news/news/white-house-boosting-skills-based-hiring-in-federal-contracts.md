  workforce by adopting skills-based hiring, reducing reliance on degree
  requirements, and emphasizing practical abilities. Agencies like the GSA and
  DoE are removing unnecessary degree prerequisites for IT and cybersecurity
  jobs, impacting over 1,000 positions and $100 billion in contracts. The Biden
  administration also expanded workforce development efforts, such as regional
  workforce hubs and semiconductor industry training programs, aiming to connect
  Americans to high-paying jobs without requiring college degrees. Additional
  commitments include community college programs and registered apprenticeships
  to further prepare workers for in-demand industries like manufacturing, IT,
  and semiconductors.
