description: "The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is planning to strengthen
  oversight of its major IT modernization contracts. This is in response to
  recent legislation from Congress. The VA has released a draft request for
  proposals (RFP) to request industry input on its plans to initiate independent
  verification and validation (IV&V) for its major acquisition programs. "
synopsis: >-
  * The RFP comes after Rep. Mark Takano introduced the VA IT Modernization
  Improvement Act, which called for IV&V support for major acquisitions.

  * VA Chief Acquisition Officer Michael Parrish stated that this will provide independent oversight to ensure that contractors deliver on time and budget.

  * The VA expects to implement this contract by the end of the year, aligning with Rep. Takano's legislation.

  * This RFP mentions that programs like the Electronic Health Record Modernization, Financial Management Business Transformation, and Supply Chain Modernization will likely be assessed, with the possibility of considering additional programs. Both VA and Government Accountability Office officials support the legislation.
