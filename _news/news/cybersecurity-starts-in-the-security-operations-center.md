description: The Security Operations Center (SoC) at a federal agency plays a
  crucial role in cybersecurity, consisting of experts who monitor systems to
  prevent or respond to security threats. Recent years have seen an increase in
  procedures to protect SoCs, guided by federal directives and a cybersecurity
  executive order enhancing cloud and network security. Management complexities
  arise regarding leadership and incident response, with a mix of federal
  employees and contractors involved. Jennifer Franks from the Government
  Accountability Office highlights the importance of a diverse skill set,
  information sharing, and the challenges of managing sensitive data across
  different agencies. Protecting critical services requires continuous effort,
  risk management, and readiness to respond to incidents.
