description: NIST's National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) has
  released a draft practice guide, Implementing a Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA),
  for public feedback. The guide simplifies the process of adopting ZTA by
  showcasing 19 example implementations created with 24 technology providers.
  These implementations include detailed instructions, models, and resources for
  IT professionals to replicate or adapt based on their needs. Organizations can
  choose from approaches like enhanced identity governance (EIG),
  software-defined perimeter (SDP), microsegmentation, or secure access service
  edge (SASE). Public feedback on the draft is open until Jan. 31, 2025, before
  finalization.
