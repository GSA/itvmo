  Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) and the Cybersecurity
  Executive Order. She said implementing the new National Cyber Strategy remains
  a key focus, including pushing agencies to encrypt data, use multi-factor
  authentication, and adopt endpoint detection and response capabilities.

  * The CISO office is prioritizing tackling technical debt by modernizing
  legacy systems, which pose security risks.

The CISO stressed that driving FISMA and the cyber executive order forward through metrics and accountability will enhance defenses against modern threats.
