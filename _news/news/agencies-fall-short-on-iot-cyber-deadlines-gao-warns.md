description: The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported that several
  federal agencies failed to meet deadlines for IoT cybersecurity requirements
  under the IoT Cybersecurity Improvement Act of 2020. The act requires agencies
  to inventory IoT devices and enforce security measures to mitigate
  vulnerabilities like malware and botnet attacks. While some agencies,
  including the State and Treasury Departments, have completed inventories,
  others are behind schedule or lack timelines. GAO criticized the Office of
  Management and Budget (OMB) for inadequate oversight and provided 11
  recommendations, including improved verification of waivers and stricter
  adherence to deadlines for inventory completion to bolster IoT security across
  agencies.
synopsis: >-
  * IoT Cybersecurity Act: The act mandates federal agencies to inventory IoT
  devices and implement security measures to address risks such as botnet and
  malware attacks.

  * Agency Delays: Three agencies missed deadlines, six lacked timelines, and only a few agencies, like State and Treasury, have completed inventories.

  * OMB Oversight Issues: Waivers were inconsistently reported, and OMB failed to verify their accuracy before submitting them to Congress.

  * GAO Recommendations: Includes verifying waiver submissions, developing plans for inventory completion, and enforcing stricter deadlines.

  * High Stakes: IoT devices are integral to federal operations, making robust cybersecurity vital to protect systems, infrastructure, and national security.
