description: The Department of Homeland Securityâ€™s Science and Technology
  Directorate has issued a solicitation for synthetic data solutions that can
  replicate real data's shape and patterns while ensuring privacy. This approach
  is seen as a potential game-changer, especially for the Cybersecurity and
  Infrastructure Security Agency, to develop realistic training scenarios and
  model environments in real-time. The National Strategy on Privacy-Preserving
  Data Sharing and Analytics highlights synthetic data as a key technology for
  unlocking data analysis benefits while protecting privacy. However, the
  adoption of synthetic data faces challenges such as limited awareness, lack of
  standards, and varying maturity levels. Verification and validation techniques
  are needed to address accuracy and data quality issues. The Chief Data
  Officers Council is also seeking input on synthetic data to establish best
  practices, including a more formalized definition, applications, challenges,
  limitations, and considerations for ethics and equity.
synopsis: >-
  * **Synthetic Data for AI Training and Testing:** Agencies are exploring
  synthetic data to build or test AI applications and machine learning models.

  * **DHS Solicitation for Synthetic Data Solutions:** DHS is seeking solutions to generate synthetic data that mirrors real data while protecting privacy, crucial for training machine learning models where real-world data is unavailable or poses risks.

  * **Potential of Synthetic Data:** Recognized for its ability to facilitate realistic training scenarios and model environments, synthetic data is seen as a significant asset for agencies like CISA.

  * **Challenges in Adoption:** The adoption of synthetic data is slow due to limited awareness, lack of standards, and varying maturity levels. There's a need for research on verification and validation techniques to ensure data accuracy and quality.

  * **Chief Data Officers Council's Involvement:** The council is seeking input to establish best practices for synthetic data generation, including its definition, applications, challenges, limitations, and ethical considerations.
