description: The government procurement process can be difficult to navigate,
  especially for businesses without experience in submitting bids or
  understanding agency requirements. There are barriers in paperwork,
  disparities in geographic distribution, poorly trained officials, and
  inequities based on race and gender.
synopsis: >-
  * To address these various issues, several reforms to national procurement
  policies and processes have been introduced.

  * These include broadening the geographic distribution of contracts, ensuring fairness and transparency, improving access for small businesses and historically disadvantaged firms, enhancing the training of government procurement officers, increasing accountability by empowering end-users, utilizing technology and machine learning software for data analysis, limiting the time period and criteria for legal challenges, and learning from reforms implemented in other countries.
