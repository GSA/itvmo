description: CISA Deputy Director Nitin Natarajan emphasized the need to address
  the growing risks of legacy operational technology (OT) systems in critical
  infrastructure sectors. Unlike legacy IT systems, OT systems are harder to
  replace and essential for industries like energy and manufacturing. Natarajan
  highlighted workforce gaps, lack of investment, and evolving adversarial
  tactics as key challenges. He called for stronger partnerships between public
  and private sectors and international collaboration to safeguard these
  systems. Natarajan also stressed the importance of bridging knowledge gaps and
  enabling organizations, particularly smaller ones, to engage with federal
  resources like CISA and the FBI.
synopsis: >-
  * Legacy OT Risks: Legacy OT systems are harder to replace and critical for
  industries such as energy and transportation, making them a unique challenge
  compared to IT systems.

  * Workforce Gaps: Insufficient workforce knowledge transfer and lack of investment have left systems vulnerable, especially for smaller organizations.

  * Evolving Threats: Adversaries are increasingly targeting vulnerable high-value environments, like schools and hospitals, previously considered off-limits.

  * Public-Private Collaboration: Strengthening engagement between organizations, federal resources (CISA, FBI), and global partners is vital for addressing these risks.

  * Call for Action: Open dialogue and proactive partnerships are essential to safeguarding critical infrastructure nationwide.
