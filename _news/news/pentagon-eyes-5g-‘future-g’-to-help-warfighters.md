description: The Department of Defense is exploring how 5G and 6G networks can
  enhance military operations in the future. 5G offers faster speeds and lower
  latency that could enable new augmented and virtual reality capabilities for
  warfighters. The Pentagon is testing 5G at a handful of military bases to
  better understand how to leverage its capabilities. Looking ahead, the DoD is
  also funding university research on 6G, the next generation of wireless
  networks that could arrive in the 2030s. 6G promises even faster speeds and
  greater connectivity for advanced applications like holographic projection.
  While commercial 5G is still rolling out, the DoD wants to get a head start on
  capitalizing on 6G’s potential military benefits. However, adopting these new
  networks also presents cybersecurity challenges that will need to be
  addressed.
