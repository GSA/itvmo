description: The federal chief information security officer (CISO) is looking
  ahead to an important conversation around new contractor cybersecurity rules.
  These rules will update regulations that IT contractors must follow to protect
  sensitive government data. The CISO expects the conversation to center around
  what should be mandated versus suggested best practices. While no specific
  timeline is set, the CISO aims to release a draft version of the updated rules
  for public comment in the coming months. This will be an important step toward
  finalizing regulations that balance security needs with flexibility for
  contractors. The CISO recognizes the challenges but believes there is momentum
  toward modernizing cyber standards.
