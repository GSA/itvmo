description: "Companies awarded federal government contracts, regardless of
  size, must ensure equal opportunity in hiring and advancement. This is to
  align with America's demographics. The numbers are not confidential and do not
  impact our competitive advantage. The federal government has a responsibility
  to mandate that contracted companies submit their reports and enforce this
  requirement. "
synopsis: >-
  * In every government contract, there should be incentives for annual report
  submission. This will require changing processes and establishing a culture
  that values diversity and equity.

  * For non-compliant companies, contracts may be suspended.

  * While diversifying the talent pool is crucial for narrowing the wealth gap and getting more people into tech jobs, it is also important for government services to be reflective of the constituents they support.

  * Access to these services will improve as the talent pool becomes more diverse.
