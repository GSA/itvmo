description: "The Biden administration has introduced new measures to enhance
  the accessibility of major government contracts for small businesses. These
  initiatives involve guidance from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
  and efforts by the Small Business Administration (SBA) to improve the
  technical assistance program. The OMB's guidance encourages federal agencies
  to adopt strategies that enable small businesses to participate in
  multiple-award contracts, which represent nearly 20% or $160 billion of
  government contract funds. Furthermore, the SBA aims to diversify technical
  assistance opportunities through its Empower to Grow (E2G) program, targeting
  small disadvantaged businesses in low-income or high-unemployment areas. The
  program will offer customizable one-on-one training to guide small businesses
  through the contract bidding process and facilitate networking and matchmaking
  events with government organizations and prime contractors. "
synopsis: >-
  * Early Engagement and Planning: Agencies are encouraged to engage and plan
  for multiple-award contracts earlier in the process.

  * On-Ramps for New Companies: The guidance suggests expanding the consideration of on-ramps to allow new companies to enter during a contract's performance period.

  * Leveraging Small Business Set Aside Orders: Agencies are advised to make use of small business set-aside orders to open up opportunities.
