description: The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has extended and modified
  direct hire authority for federal agencies to facilitate hiring in STEM,
  acquisitions, and cybersecurity roles through December 31, 2028. This
  authority simplifies the hiring process by removing ranking procedures when
  there is a candidate shortage or critical hiring need. It now includes
  criminal investigators with cybersecurity and IT expertise, covering positions
  at pay grade levels 11 through 15. Additionally, agencies can appoint
  individuals for up to 10 years for certain long-term STEM projects, and the
  Biden administration has shifted the focus of IT and cyber roles towards
  skills rather than educational qualifications.
