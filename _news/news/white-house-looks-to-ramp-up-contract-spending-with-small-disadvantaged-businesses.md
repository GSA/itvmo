description: The Biden administration is looking to increase federal contract
  spending with small disadvantaged businesses (SDBs) up to 15% by 2025. This
  initiative aims to expand opportunities for SDBs through both prime and
  subcontracting arrangements. Steps include getting more agency commitment
  through new SDB contracting goals, increasing outreach to small firms,
  leveraging SDB set-asides, and partnering SDBs with larger contractors. The
  administration will also enhance oversight and accountability to ensure
  progress. Overall the goal is to drive more federal procurement spending
  towards SDBs and strengthen the diversity of the government's contractor base.
