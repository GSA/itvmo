  leveraging AI for cybersecurity, and initiating tech-driven fraud prevention
  in Treasury operations. The order directs federal agencies to enforce secure
  software practices, strengthen open-source use, and prioritize AI-driven cyber
  defense initiatives. It emphasizes multi-agency collaboration and incentivizes
