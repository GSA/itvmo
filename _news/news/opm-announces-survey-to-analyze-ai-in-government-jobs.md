description: The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is advancing its efforts
  to integrate artificial intelligence (AI) within the federal workforce by
  launching a survey targeting federal employees engaged in AI-related tasks.
  This initiative is part of a broader strategy mandated by the 2020 AI in
  Government Act and President Biden's 2023 executive order, which aim to
  identify essential skills for federal AI roles and ensure AI's safe and secure
  use across agencies. Following the identification of 43 general and 14
  technical competencies necessary for AI work, OPM seeks to validate these
  competencies through the AI job analysis survey. The survey will involve
  employees from various departments, including the Office of Science and
  Technology Policy and chief information and data officers. The outcome will
  contribute to developing an AI competency model, potentially leading to the
  revision or creation of job series to include AI skills, and help forecast AI
  job needs in the federal government. This model aims to enhance the
  recruitment, development, and promotion of AI talent, aligning with agencies'
  missions and strategic goals.
