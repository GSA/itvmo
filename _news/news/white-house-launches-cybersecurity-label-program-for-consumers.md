description: The White House officially launched the U.S. Cyber Trust Mark, a
  cybersecurity labeling initiative aimed at enhancing the security of
  internet-connected devices. Similar to the EnergyStar label, this program
  offers clear security evaluations to guide consumer choices and incentivize
  manufacturers to meet rigorous cybersecurity standards set by NIST. Initially
  focusing on consumer products, the program will expand to enterprise devices
  and require government procurement of certified devices by 2027. Backed by the
  FCC and major retailers like Best Buy and Amazon, the initiative highlights
  public-private collaboration to address rising threats and foster trust in
  connected technologies.
