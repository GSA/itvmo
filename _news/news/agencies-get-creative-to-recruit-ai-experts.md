description: Jennifer Anastasoff, who co-founded the U.S. Digital Service,
  established the Tech Talent Project to connect technologists with government
  roles. In response to 2023 tech industry layoffs, the project organized job
  fairs, leading to over 4,700 attendees and participation from 100+ agencies.
  These efforts align with President Biden's AI talent surge directive, which
  has already resulted in 200+ hires and aims to bring in more through public
  technology fellowships and new hiring flexibilities.
