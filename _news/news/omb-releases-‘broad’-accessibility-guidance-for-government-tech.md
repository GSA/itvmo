description: OMB has released new guidance aimed at improving the accessibility
  of government technology, marking the first update to Section 508 of the
  Rehabilitation Act since 2013. The guidance addresses the concerning fact that
  nearly half of federal websites are not fully accessible, and only 23% of top
  PDF downloads from major agencies conform to 508 standards. The new guidance
  aims to instigate a culture change towards digital accessibility, emphasizing
  that it's a collective responsibility and an integral part of government
  modernization. Agencies are now required to establish a Section 508 program
  with a dedicated program manager and develop policies and procedures to ensure
  accessibility. This includes setting up digital accessibility statements on
  websites, providing feedback mechanisms for reporting issues, and conducting
  comprehensive accessibility testing before deployment. GSA is tasked with
  exploring a standardized accessibility conformance reporting process for
  vendors and establishing a government-wide service for accessibility-related
  products and services. The CIO Council will consider a government-wide program
  for assistive technology devices and consultation services. The Technology
  Modernization Fund may finance potential accessibility projects, aligning with
  the fund's customer experience allocation.
