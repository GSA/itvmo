description: The White House released its 2024 consolidated inventory of federal
  AI use cases, documenting 1,757 uses across 37 federal agencies—more than
  double last year’s 710 cases. The inventory, available on OMB’s GitHub,
  categorizes uses as mission-enabling, health and medical, and government
  services. This year, disclosures include rights- and safety-impacting uses,
  requiring enhanced risk management practices. While some agencies received
  extensions to meet these requirements, others missed the deadline. The
  Department of Health and Human Services reported the most cases (271), and
  significant growth was seen across agencies like DHS and HHS. Some classified
  uses remain aggregated but undisclosed.
