description: The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)
  launched the “CISA Services Portal” to simplify cyber incident reporting,
  integrating features like Login.gov credentials, report management, and
  informal chats with officials. This rollout precedes the implementation of the
  Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act (CIRCIA), requiring
  organizations to report serious cyber incidents within 72 hours and ransomware
  attacks within 24 hours. CISA expects over 25,000 reports annually once the
  law takes effect. To manage this, CISA plans to hire more staff, upgrade
  technology, and align CIRCIA with existing sector-specific reporting rules to
  minimize burdens on the private sector.
synopsis: >-

  reporting.
