description: There is growing demand for AI talent in the federal government and
  the challenges agencies face in recruiting and retaining skilled AI
  professionals. Nearly every federal agency has major AI initiatives underway,
  from using AI to process benefit applications to leveraging AI for national
  security purposes. However, the private sector often offers higher salaries
  and the misperception exists of federal government work being less innovative.
  The Biden Administration has introduced several efforts to close the AI talent
  gap such as the creation of the AI COE program to share best practices in AI
  adoption. Advocates also point to the need to establish an AI-literate
  workforce through re-skilling programs as only a small number of specialized
  AI experts are needed to complement such a workforce.
