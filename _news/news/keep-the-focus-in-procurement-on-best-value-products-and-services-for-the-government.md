description: 'Federal government procurement should prioritize "best value" over
  lowest cost when purchasing products and services. The best value enables the
  government to consider factors beyond just price, including quality, technical
  capability, past performance, and environmental or social impacts. '
synopsis: >-
  * Focusing solely on lowest cost can result in lower quality goods and
  services that don't fully meet the government's needs.

  * More training on best value procurement strategies is needed for acquisition professionals.\
    Additionally, updating regulations and policies can help encourage a best value approach.
  * Emphasizing best value rather than lowest cost will ultimately provide taxpayers with higher quality, more innovative, and more sustainable solutions from government contractors.
