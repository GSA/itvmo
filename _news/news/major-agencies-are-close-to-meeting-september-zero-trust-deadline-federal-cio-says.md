description: Federal agencies are close to meeting a September 30 deadline to
  adopt zero trust architecture, a cybersecurity model that requires constant
  verification for access to sensitive systems. According to federal CIO Clare
  Martorana, 24 CFO Act agencies are nearing 100% compliance, with overall
  federal completion at 87%. Zero trust implementation follows a 2021 executive
  order and a 2022 memo from the Office of Management and Budget. This
  initiative, driven by high-profile cyber incidents like the Colonial Pipeline
  attack, is seen as a continuous process to strengthen federal cybersecurity
  against evolving threats.
synopsis: >-
