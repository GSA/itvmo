description: The Intelligence Community Inspector General's biennial update on
  cybersecurity information sharing indicates progress in the last two years,
  but also identifies persistent challenges. The report evaluates the
  implementation of the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015, involving
  input from various departments and the Office of the Director of National
  Intelligence (ODNI). While policies, procedures, and guidelines for sharing
  cyber threat indicators are deemed sufficient, issues such as reluctance to
  share outside the federal collection, over-classification of information, and
  resource constraints hinder effective information sharing. Departments like
  Commerce prefer to share only within the federal collection, and private
  companies hesitate due to potential legal and competitive concerns.
  Over-classification and the effort required to declassify information delay
  its use, and transferring information from classified to unclassified systems
  poses difficulties. Additionally, resource constraints affect the review of
  incoming information, and concerns about the quality of cyber information and
  the functionality of tools like CISA's Automated Indicator Sharing capability
  further complicate the sharing process.
synopsis: >-
  * **Progress in Cyber Threat Information Sharing:** The report acknowledges
  improvements in cyber threat information sharing within the government over
  the last two years.

  * **Challenges in Sharing Outside Federal Collection:** Some departments, like Commerce, are reluctant to share outside the federal collection, and private companies are hesitant due to legal and competitive concerns.

  * **Over-Classification and Declassification Issues:** Concerns about over-classification hinder information sharing, and the process of declassifying information is seen as a significant delay.

  * **Resource Constraints:** Agencies face challenges due to a lack of personnel to review incoming information, affecting the effectiveness of information sharing.
