description: The Department of Commerce released guidance to ensure public data
  is AI-ready, focusing on improving AI accuracy and prioritizing authoritative
  data over unreliable sources. The guidance addresses documentation, data
  formats, storage, licensing, and quality to make data not just
  machine-readable but machine-understandable. This effort, led by the AI and
  Open Government Data Assets Working Group, aims to enhance public data’s
  utility for AI tools like large language models (LLMs). Commerce’s steps could
  significantly impact AI implementation across federal, academic, and private
  sectors by setting standards for structuring and disseminating data for
  AI-driven innovation.
