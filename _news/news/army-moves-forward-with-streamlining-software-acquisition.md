description: "The Defense Department's software acquisition programs are finally
  making progress after five years of struggles. The Army has set delivery
  schedules for multiple software acquisitions and plans to establish an expert
  cell for improving requirements on intellectual property licensing. Although
  victory cannot be declared yet, progress has been made. "
synopsis: >-
  * Margaret Boatner, deputy assistant secretary of the Army for strategy and
  acquisition reform, highlighted both successes and challenges at an AFCEA NOVA
  event. 

  * This approach to software acquisition acknowledges the short lifespan of technology and aims to streamline the process. The software acquisition pathway, introduced by the Pentagon in 2020, provides flexibility for acquisition professionals.

  * Currently, the Army has nine programs in the software acquisition pathway, ranging from complex to straightforward. Four of these programs are already in the execution phase with scheduled deliveries of iterative capabilities.
