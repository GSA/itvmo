description: The Biden administration is spearheading a government-wide
  initiative to bolster AI expertise within the federal workforce, led by the
  Office of Personnel Management (OPM). OPM has initiated a large-scale hiring
  action to recruit data scientists across multiple federal agencies. This
  pooled hiring approach allows candidates to apply once and be considered for
  several GS-14 data scientist positions, streamlining the recruitment process.
  The initiative aligns with President Joe Biden's executive order to accelerate
  AI usage in government operations. OPM's direct-hire authority for AI-related
  job classifications further facilitates this effort. The White House
  emphasizes the importance of leveraging AI responsibly to enhance government
  services, policy-making, and research and development, ensuring the U.S.
  remains at the forefront of AI innovation.
