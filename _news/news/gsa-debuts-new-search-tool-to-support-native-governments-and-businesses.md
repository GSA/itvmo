description: "The U.S. General Services Administration has introduced a new
  search tool. This tool allows buyers to search for Native business categories
  in GSA Advantage!, GSA eBuy, and GSA eLibrary for commercial products and
  services. Tribal governments have limited ability to generate traditional
  government revenues due to their unique federal status. Therefore, income from
  Tribal businesses is crucial for their development. "
synopsis: >-
  * The new search feature will help Native businesses gain visibility in
  various channels to sell their products and services. The search identifiers
  have been designed to enable multiple search criteria, such as office supplies
  and 8(a) status.

  * This feature helps federal agency partners comply with the Buy Indian Act. These recent enhancements to the search function enable buyers to meet socioeconomic contracting goals more efficiently and identify specific acquisition pathways.

  * Federal and Tribal buyers can now easily search for hand tools made by American Indian-owned small businesses.
