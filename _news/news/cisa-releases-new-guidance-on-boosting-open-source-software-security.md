description: "The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has
  released new guidance for improving the security of open source software. As
  open source becomes more prevalent, securing it is crucial for cybersecurity.
  CISA's guidance focuses on four key areas: understanding the open source
  ecosystem, knowing and managing dependencies, securing the software supply
  chain, and promoting secure software development practices. The guidance
  outlines best practices such as maintaining a comprehensive inventory of
  dependencies, establishing SLAs with suppliers, integrating security earlier
  into the development process, and contributing back fixes to improve software
  resilience. Overall, CISA aims to promote more secure open source development
  and use across the software ecosystem."
