description: Building cyber resilience is essential for effective disaster
  response and recovery. Real-time assessments of cyber resilience are
  necessary, requiring clear metrics to measure risks and progress. Key metrics
  include tracking identified risks, incidents, monitoring efforts, and
  mitigation success. Addressing data collection challenges is crucial to
  developing these metrics. Aligning cybersecurity efforts with frameworks like
  NIST's Cybersecurity Framework 2.0 enhances resilience, while collaboration
  between public and private sectors strengthens national cybersecurity
  defenses.
