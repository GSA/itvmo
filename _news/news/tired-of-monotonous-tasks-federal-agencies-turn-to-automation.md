description: Many federal agencies are increasingly looking to intelligent
  automation to handle repetitive, low-value tasks and enable employees to focus
  on higher-value work. RPA software can replicate human actions to complete
  routine processes like data entry. The General Services Administration has
  bots handling numerous workflows, while the IRS is automating document
  processing. Other use cases include automated FOIA request handling and
  automated security operations center functions. Agencies cite benefits like
  improved efficiency, accuracy, and employee satisfaction. However, they also
  emphasize the importance of governance and thoughtful implementation. As
  automation becomes more integral to federal IT, agencies will need strategies
  for maximizing value while managing change and mitigating risks.
