description: Nearly 200 tech and cybersecurity companies have signed the
  U.S.-led Secure by Design pledge, which commits them to incorporating default
  secure features in their products, particularly for enterprise customers and
  retail sales. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)
  initiated this pledge to address ongoing software quality issues, emphasizing
  the need for secure products rather than additional security tools. The
  pledge, first introduced at the RSA Conference, includes measures such as
  managing vulnerability disclosure programs and reducing default passwords.
  Legal experts argue that the software market lacks incentives for secure
  development, leaving customers vulnerable to cyber exploitation.
