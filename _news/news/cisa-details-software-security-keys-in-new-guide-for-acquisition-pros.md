description: The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has
  released a new Software Acquisition Guide for Government Enterprise Consumers
  to help federal acquisition professionals assess the security of software they
  purchase. Developed by the Information and Communications Technology Supply
  Chain Risk Management Task Force, the guide includes key principles like
  CISA's Secure by Design and provides questions to evaluate software security,
  aligning with ongoing efforts such as the secure software attestation form.
  This initiative is part of broader efforts, including an upcoming Federal
  Acquisition Regulatory (FAR) rule, to strengthen the government's software
  supply chain security. Additionally, CISA has appointed Lisa Einstein as its
  first Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer to oversee AI-related risks in
  critical infrastructure.
