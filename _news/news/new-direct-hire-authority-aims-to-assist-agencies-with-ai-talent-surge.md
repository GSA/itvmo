description: The federal government is granting new direct hiring authority to
  help agencies recruit talent in artificial intelligence as investments and
  applications accelerate. The Office of Personnel Management has approved
  direct hiring for over 50 AI-related positions including data scientists,
  developers, and engineers. This will allow agencies to expedite hiring,
  bypassing traditionally lengthy competitive hiring processes. As AI
  proliferates across national security, healthcare, transportation and more,
  demand for technical experts is surging. However, recruitment remains
  challenging with private sector competition. Direct hiring provides
  flexibility to attract qualified candidates to serve in government. This
  complements other federal efforts to upskill current staff and develop AI
  career paths. Though AI talent is scarce, empowering agencies to hire rapidly
  and competitively at scale will build critical personnel pipelines to support
  ethical and responsible adoption.
