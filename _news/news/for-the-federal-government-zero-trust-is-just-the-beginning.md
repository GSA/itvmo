description: The federal government is increasingly adopting zero trust security
  models, but sees it as just the first step towards more advanced approaches to
  cybersecurity. Zero trust is focused on constantly validating every user and
  device before granting the minimum access needed, but has limitations. The
  government is looking towards concepts like assume breach, which assumes
  systems are compromised from the start, and evolving to self-healing networks
  that can automatically detect and respond to threats. The ability to
  understand normal behavior and identify anomalies will be critical. There also
  needs to focus on identity management as the foundation for these future
  security architectures.
