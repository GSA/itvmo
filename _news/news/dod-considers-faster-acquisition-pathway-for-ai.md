description: The Defense Department’s software acquisition pathway, designed to
  streamline software development, has seen slow adoption, with only 50 programs
  utilizing it. The Army, in particular, is considering creating a sub-path
  within the software pathway specifically for artificial intelligence (AI) to
  accelerate AI development and deployment. Young Bang, the Army’s principal
  deputy assistant secretary for acquisition, logistics, and technology,
  highlights the need for a faster path for AI, given the rapid cycles required
  for algorithm development. The Army is working with the Office of the
  Secretary of Defense to explore this faster process, potentially incorporating
  AI into the existing software acquisition framework.
synopsis: >-
  * The Army is considering a separate AI-specific sub-path within the software
  pathway.

  * AI development requires faster cycles than the current minimum viable capability release (MVCR) timeline of one year.

  * The software pathway offers flexibility, but AI requires shorter development timelines for faster deployment.

  * Army leadership is collaborating with the Office of the Secretary of Defense to develop a more agile AI acquisition process.
