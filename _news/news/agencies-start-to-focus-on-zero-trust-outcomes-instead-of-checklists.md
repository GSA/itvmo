description: Federal agencies aim to adopt zero trust cybersecurity
  architectures by September 30, 2024, following the White House's 2022
  strategy. Progress is seen in modernizing zero trust concepts, focusing on
  outcomes, and particularly on identity security. However, challenges remain
  due to the federated nature of agencies. AI and automation are viewed as
  essential tools for enhancing cybersecurity, though they also present risks.
  Agencies must balance leveraging AI while ensuring data security.
