description: The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued a memo on January
  25, 2024, aimed at increasing small business participation in multiple-award
  contracts (MACs). This directive encourages federal procurement agencies to
  apply the "rule of two," which mandates that if at least two small businesses
  can perform the required work at a fair price, the competition should be
  limited to small businesses. However, the Federal Supply Schedule is exempt
  from this rule. The memo has sparked a debate over its implications, including
  whether it represents a significant policy shift without undergoing the
  standard rule-making process, its impact on medium and large businesses,
  potential increases in procurement costs due to reduced competition, and the
  likelihood of increased litigation and procurement delays.
synopsis: >-
  * The OMB memo, issued on January 25, 2024, aims to boost small business
  participation in multiple-award contracts by advocating for the "rule of two."

  * It specifies that if two or more small businesses can offer fair market prices, competitions should be limited to them, excluding the Federal Supply Schedule.

  * The memo has sparked discussions regarding its potential to change procurement dynamics, particularly affecting medium and large businesses and possibly leading to increased procurement costs due to less competition.

  * Concerns have been raised about the memo's bypassing of the standard rule-making process, its impact on federal contracting, and the possibility of increased litigation and procurement delays.
