description: The Small Business Administration (SBA) proposed a rule on October
  25 to expand the rule of two to task and delivery orders under multiple award
  contracts (MACs). Agencies must set aside such contracts for small businesses
  if two qualified small firms can compete, except in limited cases like GSA
  schedule contracts. This marks a significant shift in small business
  contracting, potentially redistributing up to $6.1 billion annually to small
  firms. While proponents see the rule as a way to combat declining small
  business participation in federal contracting, critics argue it could disrupt
  the efficiency of MACs and harm small firms long-term.
synopsis: >-
  * Proposed Rule Overview: SBAâ€™s rule extends the rule of two to MACs and
  GWACs, mandating small business set-asides where applicable.

  * Economic Impact: SBA estimates $6.1 billion in missed small business awards could be addressed by applying the rule of two.

  * Diverging Opinions: Critics fear disruptions to MACs may harm small businesses, while proponents see it as reversing declining small business participation.

  * Small Business Trends: Federal small business contracting hit $178.6 billion in 2023, but prime contractors have declined by 40% since 2010.
