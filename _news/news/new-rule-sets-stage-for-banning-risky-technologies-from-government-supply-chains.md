description: The General Services Administration has issued a rule to implement
  provisions in the 2021 defense bill that allow the government to prohibit
  federal acquisition of certain telecom and video surveillance equipment. The
  rule lays the groundwork to block purchase of technology that poses national
  security risks, namely gear from Chinese companies like Huawei and ZTE. It
  establishes procedures for assessing risks, identifying covered equipment,
  providing notice to vendors, and allowing waivers in special cases. While not
  an outright ban yet, the rule is a significant step toward enabling stricter
  screening of government technology supply chains. It reflects growing concerns
  about potential vulnerabilities from foreign-sourced gear that could enable
  spying or disruption of government systems and operations.
