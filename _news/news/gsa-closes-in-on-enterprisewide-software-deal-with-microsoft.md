description: The General Services Administration (GSA) is nearing completion of
  a governmentwide framework for standardized software contract terms with
  Microsoft, addressing challenges identified by the Office of Federal
  Procurement Policy (OFPP) under its Better Contracting Initiative (BCI). This
  effort aims to streamline software procurement, reduce pricing disparities,
  and enhance federal cybersecurity. The initiative involves 24 key terms and
  conditions, based on extensive analysis of contracts from the 24 CFO Act
  agencies. GSA's optimism stems from collaboration with agencies and lessons
  from past initiatives. While Microsoft is the first focus, similar agreements
  with other major vendors are anticipated.
