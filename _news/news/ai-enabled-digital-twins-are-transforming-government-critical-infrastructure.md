description: Digital twins are increasingly utilized in public and private
  sectors for creating virtual models of physical objects or spaces, enhancing
  decision-making, reducing costs, and increasing safety and efficiency. These
  models, especially when AI-enabled, address key challenges in government
  critical infrastructure by providing dynamic, real-time data inputs to monitor
  and optimize processes, ensuring high reliability and minimum downtime.
  Digital twins are essential for operations in sectors like defense, energy,
  and public health, allowing for continuous improvement and proactive
  maintenance.
