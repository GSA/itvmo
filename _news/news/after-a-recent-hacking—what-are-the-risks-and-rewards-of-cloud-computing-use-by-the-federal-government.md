description: "A recent GAO report examined the risks and rewards of federal
  cloud adoption following high-profile hacking incidents involving cloud
  services. While highlighting cloud benefits like flexibility and potential
  cost savings, auditors cautioned agencies to address unique security
  challenges. Because cloud environments are shared between organizations,
  compromised credentials could endanger other clients. "
synopsis: >-
  * Auditors recommended agencies rigorously monitor access and take full
  advantage of cloud security controls. However, continuously monitoring cloud
  configurations and staying current on patches remains challenging for
  resource-strapped agencies.

  * Further, complex cloud architectures make assessing risks difficult. But if secured properly, cloud's enhanced automation and centralized management can bolster defenses across agencies.

  * GAO advised applying security best practices and leveraging FedRAMP requirements to ensure the benefits of cloud outweigh the risks.

  * Though challenges persist, rigorous implementation of cloud security can help agencies combat modern cyber threats.
