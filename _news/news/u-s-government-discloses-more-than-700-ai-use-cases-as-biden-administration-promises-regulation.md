description: The Biden administration recently disclosed more than 700 examples
  of how federal agencies are using artificial intelligence as part of its
  commitment to transparency around AI adoption. The use cases span various
  departments and highlight AI applications like predictive analytics at
  Veterans Affairs, automated document processing at Labor, and object
  identification for aerospace images at NASA. While showing the broad utility
  of AI across government, the disclosures also aim to build public trust by
  demonstrating that agencies are deploying AI responsibly and ethically. This
  revelation of AI use comes as the White House develops guidance to regulate AI
  development and usage. The administration says new rules are needed to manage
  AI risks related to privacy, security, bias and safety. Though many advocates
  welcome oversight, some industry groups argue excessive regulation could
  stifle AI innovation. The disclosed use cases indicate the U.S. government
  will continue expanding its AI capabilities while trying to strike a balance
  between progress and prudence.
