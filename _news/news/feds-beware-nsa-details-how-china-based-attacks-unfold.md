description: The National Security Agency (NSA), in collaboration with the
  Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) and other agencies, has released a
  cybersecurity advisory detailing the tactics of a Chinese state-sponsored
  cyber group, APT40. Known for targeting organizations in the U.S. and
  Australia since 2017, APT40 exploits vulnerabilities in widely used software
  and uses compromised devices, including home office devices, for its
  operations. The advisory outlines how APT40 quickly exploits new public
  vulnerabilities, such as those in Log4J and Microsoft Exchange, and provides
  mitigation strategies for network defenders.
synopsis: >-
  * APT40 Overview: The group, linked to the PRC Ministry of State Security,
  targets government networks using advanced cyber espionage techniques.

  * Exploitation Tactics: APT40 focuses on exploiting public-facing infrastructure vulnerabilities rather than user-initiated actions like phishing.

  * Compromised Devices: The group uses end-of-life or unpatched small-office/home-office (SOHO) devices for attacks, blending in with normal network traffic.

  * Mitigation Strategies: The advisory recommends comprehensive logging, prompt patching, network segmentation, close monitoring of services, and disabling unused network services.
