description: Recently the Department of Defense has been embracing zero trust as
  a new approach to cybersecurity according to speakers at DAFITC 2023. The DoD
  sees zero trust as a way to enhance protections for critical data and assets.
  Adopting zero trust will require changes to identity management, network
  segmentation, and device security. The DoD plans to issue a zero trust
  reference architecture to guide implementation across services and agencies.
  Challenges include educating users and integrating legacy systems. But zero
  trust offers benefits like improved visibility, granular access controls, and
  operational resilience. DoD's path to zero trust aligns with government-wide
  efforts to transition away from perimeter-based security models.
  Implementation will take years but is critical to enable multi-domain
  operations.
