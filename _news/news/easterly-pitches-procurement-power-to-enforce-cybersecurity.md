description: Jen Easterly, the Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure
  Security Agency (CISA), emphasized the significant leverage the Federal
  government has in enforcing security standards through procurement processes
  at the GovernmentDX event in D.C. She highlighted the government's ability to
  mandate security standards for software vendors as a critical tool for
  enhancing cybersecurity. This approach supports the implementation of
  President Bidenâ€™s cybersecurity executive order aimed at securing the software
  supply chain. Additionally, the introduction of a secure software development
  attestation form and compliance with the National Institute of Standards and
  Technology guidelines are central to these efforts, ensuring that all
  third-party software meets baseline cybersecurity standards before being
  utilized by Federal agencies.
synopsis: >-
  * The Federal government uses its procurement power to enforce security
  standards among software vendors.

  * The release of a secure software development attestation form is part of efforts to comply with President Biden's 2021 cybersecurity executive order.

  * This form aligns with an OMB directive from September 2022, requiring adherence to NIST guidance on software security.

  * CISA promotes a "secure-by-design" approach, emphasizing that building resilience into software from the design phase is essential for operational effectiveness and security.
