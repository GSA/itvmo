description: "Senator Joni Ernst recently criticized federal agencies for
  consistently receiving high grades on the Small Business Administration's
  annual small business procurement scorecard despite missing statutory
  contracting goals. Ernst argued agencies should not be earning \"easy As\"
  when they are failing to meet their goals for small business contracting
  dollars. She said agencies need to do more to remove barriers to entry and
  actively contract with small firms. "
synopsis: >-
  * Ernst suggested the SBA reconsider how grades are calculated to better
  reflect agencies' actual small business utilization.

  * For example, the Department of Defense received an "A" on the latest scorecard despite awarding only 26.5% of contracts to small businesses.

  * S﻿enator Ernst pushed for more accountability, calling out the Department of Energy and the General Services Administration for also underperforming small business goals while maintaining high grades. She urged incorporating scorecard results into officials’ evaluations.
