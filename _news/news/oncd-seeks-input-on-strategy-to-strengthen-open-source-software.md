description: "The National Cyber Director's office has issued a request for
  information to help shape a new government-wide strategy for leveraging open
  source software. The strategy aims to strengthen cybersecurity, lower costs,
  and benefit from community-driven innovation. The RFI seeks feedback on
  establishing procurement best practices, increasing open source contributions
  from agencies, addressing dependencies like foreign-developed software,
  measuring ROI, and more. "
synopsis: >-
  * Inputs will inform policy recommendations in several areas including
  workforce, Intellectual Property, and supply chain security around open source
  adoption.

  * The strategy will also look at DevSecOps approaches and other technical considerations.

  * According to the NCD, properly harnessing open source will enhance resilience, lower barriers to entry, and benefit national economic competitiveness. But challenges remain around security, licensing, and sustainment.

  * This RFI underscores the administrationâ€™s growing focus on maximizing open source to transform government digital services.
