  streamline and standardize cyber incident reporting across critical
  infrastructure sectors. The goal is to enable consistent reporting to CISA to
  improve national situational awareness and provide targeted support. Key
  proposals include using a standard format for reporting, establishing common
  data elements, and sharing information on incidents in real-time. Stakeholder
  feedback will help refine the recommendations before they are finalized as
  reporting requirements. Standardized reporting is part of broader efforts to
  enhance public-private cooperation on cybersecurity and create a unified view
  of threats across critical infrastructure.
