description: The Department of Defense is encouraging defense agencies and
  military services to utilize the Joint Warfighting Cloud Capability (JWCC) for
  their cloud computing needs. JWCC is the DoD's enterprise-wide cloud program
  providing both unclassified and classified capabilities.
synopsis: >-
  * The Pentagon wants to consolidate cloud contracts under JWCC to improve
  security, interoperability, and cost-savings.

  * Recently the DoD CIO released a memo directing that all DoD components moving applications to the cloud must first consider JWCC rather than procuring their own cloud services. 

  * Some DoD entities have already embraced JWCC, like the Army which plans to migrate many applications. However, others like the Air Force have been more hesitant to use the mandated cloud solution over commercial options.

  * The DoD aims to make JWCC more attractive by adding new features and services tailored for defense users.
