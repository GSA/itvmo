description: The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is
  establishing a new office dedicated to advancing zero trust security
  principles across federal agencies, aligning with the Biden administration's
  broader cybersecurity strategy. Announced by Sean Connelly, CISAâ€™s senior
  cybersecurity architect, at the Zero Trust Summit, the Zero Trust Initiative
  Office aims to provide federal agencies with comprehensive training,
  resources, and guidance on implementing zero trust architectures. This
  initiative is part of a concerted effort to enhance cybersecurity defenses by
  adopting a zero trust framework, which assumes no entity inside or outside the
  network is trusted by default.
synopsis: >-
  * The Zero Trust Initiative Office will focus on education, training, and
  resource provision to federal agencies.

  * It will build upon existing CISA guidance, including the Zero Trust Maturity Model and Trusted Internet Connections 3.0.

  * The office plans to foster community building and collaboration through interagency working groups focused on zero trust implementation and network modernization.

  * Part of its mandate includes assessing agencies' zero trust maturity and developing metrics and benchmarks to track progress towards implementing the zero trust model effectively.
