description: Cyberattacks on public sector organizations are increasingly
  targeting mobile devices and using phishing as a key attack vector. The 2024
  Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report highlights that phishing accounted
  for 66% of breaches in the public sector, with attackers focusing on social
  engineering through mobile devices. The rise of BYOD policies and cloud
  dependence has introduced new vulnerabilities, making mobile security
  critical. To defend against these threats, organizations must implement
  advanced mobile security, test defenses, and prioritize strong identity and
  data protection protocols to safeguard sensitive information from modern cyber
  kill chains.
