description: Preliminary numbers from a new climate evaluation indicate
  potential damage to federal property. It is crucial for the country to take
  action now. The president's budget request for fiscal 2024 examines the
  increased costs and risks to the federal government due to climate change.
  This analysis fulfills the requirements of President Biden's executive order
  on climate-related financial risks issued in May 2021. The budget documents
  emphasize the importance of investing in climate change to responsibly manage
  funding on behalf of taxpayers.
synopsis: >-
  * Mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to future climate scenarios
  through federal investments can help reduce future financial burdens. 

  * However, congressional appropriations and federal implementation are necessary to address these risks. 

  * Regarding sea level rise, the assessment reveals a lack of available climate data to accurately estimate the cost implications on federal facilities. Nevertheless, an illustrative analysis using limited public data suggests that the annual replacement value affected by sea level rise could range from $72 million to $127 million by mid-century and from $449 million to $1.786 billion by the end of the century. 

  * The Biden administration emphasizes the need for better data and modeling to accurately assess the true cost of climate change.
