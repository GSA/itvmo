description: The GAO report reveals that while federal agencies have initiated
  AI implementation, they still need to fulfill key requirements. Agencies
  reported about 1,200 AI use cases, mostly in the planning phase. However, gaps
  in data completeness and accuracy were found in these inventories. The report
  also notes that certain agencies have not fully met AI implementation
  requirements set by executive orders and federal law. This incomplete
  compliance hinders effective management and oversight of AI use within these
  agencies.
