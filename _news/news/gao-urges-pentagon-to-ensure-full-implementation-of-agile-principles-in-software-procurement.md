description: "A recent report from the Government Accountability Office (GAO)
  recommends the Department of Defense fully implement agile principles when
  procuring software. Agile development delivers software in short increments
  rather than waiting for the full system to be completed. "
synopsis: >-
  * The GAO found the DoD has guidance on using these methods, but program
  offices are not consistently adopting agile methods or applying them
  effectively. This can limit the flexibility and collaboration of developers
  with users that are central to agile.

  * The report recommends several actions to integrate agile further, including revising policies to mandate key agile practices, providing better training and resources to program staff, and developing metrics to measure the effectiveness of agile methods.

  * Implementing these recommendations would help the DoD deliver needed software capabilities to warfighters faster and stay ahead of evolving threats.
