description: "The Government Accountability Office reviewed 93 legal challenges
  to the National Institutes of Health's solicitation, CIO-SP4. They found that
  the agency did not advance proposals past the first phase of evaluation in a
  reasonable manner. Kenneth E. Patton, the managing associate general counsel
  for procurement law at GAO, stated that the agency's decision was flawed
  because NIH failed to show proper evaluation of phase one proposals and
  determination of which ones would move forward. "
synopsis: >-
  * GAO recommended that the agency reevaluate the proposals and make new
  determinations based on the results.

  * This decision was issued under a protective order due to sensitive information.

  * Protests from entities represented by outside counsel were addressed, while protests from entities without counsel will be addressed separately. CIO-SP4 has faced protests since the agency requested proposals in May 2021. The contract vehicle has a $50 billion ceiling.
