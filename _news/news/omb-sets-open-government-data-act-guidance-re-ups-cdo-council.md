description: The Biden administration released long-awaited guidance for federal
  agencies on implementing the OPEN Government Data Act, six years after its
  passage. The guidance, issued by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB),
  requires agencies to make data accessible, machine-readable, and part of a
  consolidated online Federal catalog, in line with the Evidence Act signed in
  2019. The delay in guidance issuance was attributed to the administration
  transition and COVID-19. The memo highlights the value of open data for
  transparency, innovation, and decision-making. It includes nine deliverables
  and reestablishes the Chief Data Officer Council, reinforcing agency
  compliance and data governance.
