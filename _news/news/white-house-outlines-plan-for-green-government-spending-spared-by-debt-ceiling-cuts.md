description: The Biden administration's goals to eliminate carbon emissions from
  federal buildings and vehicles were not affected by the bipartisan deal to cut
  government spending and raise the debt ceiling. Heather Boushey, a member of
  the White House Council of Economists, confirmed that the environmental
  components of the Inflation Reduction Act were not reduced. This is positive
  news and reflects the ongoing conversations and concerns surrounding this
  issue.
synopsis: >-
  * Boushey expressed concerns about substantial cuts to the IRS's modernization
  fund as part of the debt ceiling deal. 

  * Federal agencies are actively exploring ways to make their buildings and vehicles more sustainable in order to achieve the administration's target of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and a 65% reduction by 2030.
