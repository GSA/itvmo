            Emerging technology and innovation are needed by the government from both large and small businesses. In fact, many small businesses harvest the emerging technology and innovation that are key to supporting important federal government transformation. Small businesses, both seasoned firms and those new to government contracting, need to determine which agency is best aligned with its capabilities and if its skill sets meet the requirements set forth by agency contracting offices. The networking session will feature representatives from several agency OSDBUs, where they can discuss specific agency forecasts and upcoming opportunities. Additionally, companies can share their corporate capabilities.

            In November 2021, President Biden signed into law the Minority Business Development Act of 2021. The Act mandates the Minority Business Development Agency’s (MBDA) elevation into a pivotal government leader and prioritizes the success of America’s minority business enterprises (MBEs) like never before. The Act expands the reach and scope of the organization by establishing Senate-confirmed leadership, a robust grants program, an advisory council, and establishing the MBDA as the United States’ newest permanent federal agency. As a part of the IT Government-wide Category's small business utilization key performance indicator, you will learn more about how the expansion will address systemic barriers for minority communities and MBEs to access federal programs, grants, contracts, and technical assistance to seek opportunities in the IT arena.
