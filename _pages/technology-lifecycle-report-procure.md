<div class="margin-bottom-2">Technology lifecycle management is the compilation of disciplines managing all aspects of technology, from concept to disposal, throughout the technologyâ€™s useful life to the business. There are many different methodologies in play across the government that address the mechanisms and processes in place to manage their technology. This document is intended to be a general reference of common stages of the Technology Lifecycle and how the ITVMO interacts within the various stages.

              <p>Business analysts and business leadership need to communicate with technology analysts (EA, DA) and technology leadership to brainstorm viable paths forward. It is also the primary point to look for innovation opportunities to improve process, performance and productivity. It is with this understanding that the intersection between the business needs and the technical environment comes to consensus on appropriate technologies to create the solution. The solution does not necessarily imply a 100% new approach. It should leverage existing assets, software, services and technologies to maximize the value to the organization.</p>

            <p>This stage of the TLC begins the operational lifecycle. It is where considerations around change, down time, risk and operational disruption are evaluated to finalize the implementation plan that integrates into the current technology landscape. Depending on the type of initiative, many different disciplines (ITIL, Service Management, PMI, SDLC, etc) may be engaged to follow through from the design effort to implementation. A critical aspect of this stage of the TLC is inventory tracking and management of assets. Physical assets as well as soft assets, such as software licensing, are inventoried by an auditable process to safeguard the organizationâ€™s expenditures and meet compliance (vendor, government) requirements. The inventory and asset management practices established at this point are key to tracking the disposition and dependencies of the items throughout their useful life.</p>

This would include all types of quality assurance, regression testing, performance testing, acceptance testing and preparation of production environments. It provides a plan and roadmap that takes the initiative to the point where it is in use and provides value to the organization. Communication to the impacted constituents is critical to the success of the implementation. Whether it is an enterprise-wide system replacement, network speed, architecture change, or simply provisioning a license, the constituents must be informed of the schedule, trained appropriately and understand the impact. The results and execution of the change management plans from the integration stage are critical to the success of the actual deployment.</p>

            <p>No technology system or service operates without support. Support provides the basis for long term client success in enabling the mission with technology. Support comes into play in many facets and is likely provided in a tiered structure by the operational team or a specific support team. It includes but is not limited to direct assistance to the client base, ongoing maintenance, patching and upgrades of SaaS systems to the current release. Some support may be implemented by automated tools while other is done manually by the operational or support team.</p>

            <p>Near the end of the technology lifecycle some technologies themselves or features and functions of the technology may lose favor in light of newer technologies, faster performance, richer feature set, etc. Although the technology may remain available or allowed, at this point it is possibly not secure, not recommended, inefficient, or its shortcomings overshadow its value. This impacts all forms of technology, including software, hardware, systems, architecture and process.</p>

            <p>Whether it is the modernization of old technology to new, or the replacement of existing technology at the end of its lifespan,  it is important to determine the value to the organization and government as an input for evaluating and assessing future technology needs. Refresh objectives are driven by past performance and future business strategies to optimize the devices and system components supporting the goals of the organization. Data gathered from other aspects of the TLC should inform which products or vendors have fallen short of expectation and which products or vendors have exceeded expectation. These data generally relate to physical hardware assets in the areas of network, voice and end user devices but also should apply to software related services.</p>
