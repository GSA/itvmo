<p>In March, the ITVMO launched an initiative to bring together the federal government's foremost experts on specific large IT vendors. These integrated project teams (IPTs) made up of IT acquisition subject matter experts will conduct assessments on the hardest acquisitions challenges federal agencies face when buying IT products and services and provide actionable recommendations for agencies to improve their IT acquisitions in the future. </p>

<p>The IPTs will focus on some of the largest original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and IT vendors that serve nearly every agency and department throughout the federal government.</p>

<p>The IPTs are government-only at this time, but if you're interested in learning more, please reach out to the ITVMO inbox at <a href="mailto:itvmo@gsa.gov">itvmo@gsa.gov</a>.</p>
