heading-description: "The ITVMO as part of the larger Federal Category Management Framework, works in tandem with the Governmentwide IT Category Program to drive down federal IT costs through compliance, spend under management, and cost avoidance."
description: "The IT Category is one of ten categories in the Federal Governmentwide Category Management Framework. The government implemented category management to think more like an enterprise to buy smarter and more efficiently as a government. Category Management is the practice of buying common goods and services that everyone already buys, but buying them smarter. Governmentwide IT policy provides the rules, regulations, and guidelines that govern the use, management, and acquisition of IT within the federal government. The goal is to ensure that IT resources are used efficiently, securely, and in a manner that best serves the public interest. Executive orders (EO) play a crucial role in shaping these policies, as they are directives issued by the President of the United States to manage operations within the federal government. Over the years, various EOs have been issued to improve cybersecurity, promote transparency, enhance digital service delivery, strengthen market equity, and more. These orders influence how federal agencies invest in, adopt, and leverage IT to fulfill their missions and serve the American public."
