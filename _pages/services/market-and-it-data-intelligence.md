heading-description: "The ITVMO combines collections of data to form predictive narratives and increases use of disparate data through guides and how-to aids to better IT acquisition decision-making, governmentwide."
description: "The ITVMO plays a pivotal role throughout many stages of the acquisition life cycle. At the front end the ITVMO can assist in providing resources that evaluate new technologies against past purchases and future needs. It enhances the purchasing process through vendor relationships. And in the latter stages the ITVMO can utilize historical data to aid in the vendor selection and purchasing of replacement technologies. Currently, contract data does not accurately represent spending on IT products and services. This is in part due to issues with data inputs that do not provide an appropriate representation of the IT products and services that are being purchased, which limits the ability to provide meaningful analytics and reporting. In FY21 a new structure was collaboratively derived to address both the IT Community need to identify the spend and type of technology resource being acquired, and the acquisition community need to identify the method of acquisition. This retained the existing 4 character code limitation without interfering with any other existing PSCs in use."
