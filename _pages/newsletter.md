    <h2 class="margin-top-0 centerHeading">Announcing New Emerging Tech / Artificial Intelligence Working Group</h2>
    <div class="margin-bottom-2">
        The ITVMO’s IT Buyers COP, in collaboration with the GSA Office of Innovation, is chartering a working group with the goal of identifying governmentwide and agency specific standards for using emerging technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) to revolutionize the federal procurement process. 
    </div>
    <div class="margin-bottom-2">
    Today, agency IT buyers are getting locked into multi-year, broad scope contracts before fully understanding the procured emerging technology’s (e.g., AI) solution capability, use, or operability standards. 
    </div>
    <div class="margin-bottom-2">
    The new working group will pull agency use cases and best practices to inform strategies and encourage cross-agency collaboration. The effort seeks domain expertise from agency practitioners and industry leaders to develop guidance and tools that will support agency buyers in their procurement and use of emerging technology. The end goal is to drive business efficiencies at the agency and governmentwide scale. 
    </div>
    <div class="margin-bottom-2">
    Join the April IT Buyers CoP to hear more on emerging technology trends and the use of AI in the federal government. The April CoP will also formally announce the working group and call for participants.

    <h2 class="margin-top-0 centerHeading">A Strong Start to Fiscal Year 2023</h2>
    <div class="margin-bottom-2">
    The ITVMO in collaboration with the Governmentwide IT Category is preparing for the upcoming mid-year reviews with the Category Management Leadership Council and OMB. As the program takes a look back on the past 6 months, the organization is starting to ramp up for a big close to the fiscal year. 
    <img alt="Picture of the FY2023 a look back" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/FY23-a-look-back.png">
    Already this fiscal year, the ITVMO has provided 287 continuing learning points to agency practitioners for participation in events like the IT Buyers End of Year Meeting on IT BIC Solutions. The program has also collaborated with ServiceNow to host a 6-part Webinar Series that is now published on OMB MAX. In addition, the ITVMO.gsa.gov Resource Library has more than doubled in size with 52 new cards added over the past two quarters. As a one-stop shop for IT acquisition intelligence, the website is critical to brokering access to inhouse created and partner developed resources across the federal IT marketplace.
