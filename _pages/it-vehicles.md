heading-description: "The ITVMO works with the Federal Acquisition Programs to amplify IT Best-in-Class solution success to improve spend under management and increase market equity and compliance."
description: "Best-in-class (BIC) is a government-wide designation for acquisition solutions that can be used by multiple agencies and that satisfy key criteria defined by the White House Office of Management and Budget. Best practices such as reducing contract duplication, better leveraging the Government's collective buying power, and providing transparency that leads to better data-driven business decisions help agencies achieve those outcomes. BIC vehicles include terms and conditions, data collection and reporting requirements that reduce administrative burdens and costs, drive greater transparency, standardize and provide data and analytics to inform business decisions, and begin to eliminate practices that dilute or reduce the Governmentâ€™s purchasing power."
