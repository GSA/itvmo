<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/05/17/2021-10460/improving-the-nations-cybersecurity">E.O. 14028: Ensuring the Future is Made in All of America by All of America’s Workforce</a>: The Federal Government must improve its efforts to identify, deter, protect against, detect, and respond to the increasingly sophisticated malicious campaigns that threaten the public and private sector, and ultimately the American people’s security and privacy.</p>
</section>

<h3>Goals</h3>
<ul>
<li>Improve government efforts to identify, deter, protect against, detect, and respond to cyber campaigns and threats; in addition, apply lessons learned from cyber incidents. </li>
<li>Adapt to the continuously changing threat environment to ensure federal marketplace products are built and operate securely. </li>
<li>Foster a more secure cyberspace. </li>
</ul>

<section class="margin-top-3">
<h3>Responsible Office</h3> 
<p>The EO has assigned authoritative responsibilities to various agencies, including GSA (through the <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/">Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP)</a>), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) (through the <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/cybersecurity">Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)</a>), and the Department of Commerce (through the <a href="https://www.nist.gov/">National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)</a> and the <a href="https://www.ntia.doc.gov/">National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA)</a>). Many of these responsibilities involve coordination among the above named agencies to develop standards and guidance that will serve as the basis for updating cybersecurity policies and procedures at the individual agency level. Consult the executive order and the related guidance referenced below to understand the full scope of responsibilities.</p>
