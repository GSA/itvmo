<div class="margin-bottom-2">There is a critical requirement to strengthen the security resilience and to protect critical services for the federal government through enhancing and improving the Cyber solutions purchased by the Federal Government. Executive Order 14028, Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity, moves to enhance the government’s cybersecurity posture through initiatives to secure the software supply chain, cloud services, zero trust architecture, and mandates the deployment of multifactor authentication and encryption within a specific time period.  As a result, Federal agency IT buyers are faced with some of these challenges:

<ul>
  <li>Lack of NIST/CISA Guidance and Tools.</li>
  <li>Lack of playbooks, guides and tools.</li>
  <li>Reliance on sellers as they are more knowledgeable.</li>
  <li>Need for GWACs/BICs.</li>
  <li>Harmonizing of EO and OMB memorandums.</li>
  <li>Need for more efficient and streamlined processes to procure Cyber solutions.</li>
  <li>Multiple cybersecurity providers on BICs who all state they sell cybersecurity.</li>
</ul>

              Our goal is to focus on contracts, processes, tools, templates or knowledge sharing. The government must: 
              <ul>
                <li><b>Provide access to vehicles and resources to drive efficient acquisition processes</b>: Enable an agency who has a requirement to gain access to the right GWACs/BICs that can meet those requirements, and then be able to go through the process as efficiently as possible by having access to templates, RFI/solicitations, common SLAs, standard terms, conditions, pricing, etc.</li>
                <li><b>Collaboration across IT and Acquisition professionals</b>:  Achieve a whole-of-government approach by working collectively across federal acquisition programs. The CCT will be chaired by an agency that will set agenda, direction, and deliverables.  Members will include IT practitioners from agencies and BIC solution holders who will share ideas, artifacts, and expertise.  </li>
                <li><b>Develop library of relevant acquisition materials</b>: The ITVMO acts as a broker and resource library to compile the best thinking and information on IT acquisitions from across government. The ITVMO will provide logistics support and help to broker CCT deliverables to IT buyers/agency customers.</li>
                <li><b>Provide tools to assist federal buyers of Cybersecurity</b>: Review cyber offerings and identify standard requirements, pricing, and terms and conditions.  Evaluate the need and effectiveness of market research tools for IT buyers.</li>
