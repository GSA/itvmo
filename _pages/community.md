<h2>What We Do</h2>
<p>The ITB CoP helps agencies procure IT faster and smarter by creating a shared space where IT buyers throughout the government can help each other solve problems and leverage the buying power of the entire federal government.</p>

<h2>Who We Are</h2>
<p>We are a community of diverse federal professionals looking to leverage our respective expertise to collaborate on better IT acquisition strategies and approaches for the benefit of our agencies and all of the government.</p>

<p>The ITB CoP is supported by a partner team made up of the CIO Council’s Enterprise Operations Committee (E-ops), Chief Acquisition Officers Council (CAOC), the IT Vendor Management Office (ITVMO), and the major IT Best in Class (BIC) Contract Vehicle from GSA, DOD, NASA, and NIH.</p>

<p>Membership to the ITB CoP is government-only. The IT Buyers CoP will periodically conduct events with industry and vendor participants. Government-only membership restrictions allow federal IT Buyers to solve potentially vendor-specific or otherwise sensitive issues in a closed environment.</p>
