<h2>Campaign Overview</h2>
<p>The ITVMO is interested in learning from the federal government and industry community how  to improve communication channels and collaboration opportunities. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
    <li>What mechanisms (i.e., tools, practices) can be used or created to engage industry in open, ongoing, and transparent dialogue about procurement issues and challenges?</li>
    <li>How can the federal government effectively co-create requirements with industry?</li>
    <li>How can we strengthen vendor and supplier relationships?</li>
    <li>How can we improve communication with industry?</li>
    <li>How can we promote a diverse federal IT marketplace?</li>
</ul>
<p>Submit your innovative ideas on the IdeaScale platform and upvote, comment, and follow any ideas or suggestions you think would improve government and IT vendor communication and collaboration. The ITVMO and OMB will consider ideas based on community voting and comments, feasibility, and alignment to Administration priorities and governmentwide vendor management initiatives.</p>
<h3>What is EPIC?</h3>
<p>Engaging Procurement Ideas to Consider (EPIC) is an OFPP initiative to crowdsource innovative ideas to improve governmentwide acquisition and inform the new Administration’s President’s Management Agenda (PMA).</p>
<p>EPIC campaigns are open to everyone. Submit big and small ideas for improving procurement. Good ideas often come from the collision of smaller ideas that come together to form bigger ideas that have potential to become revolutionary ideas. EPIC campaigns provide space for those smaller ideas to collide, come together and become something greater than the sum of their parts. By participating in the EPIC Campaign, you have the opportunity to contribute the missing piece to complete the idea that will facilitate rapid and meaningful progress in the field of federal procurement.</p>
