<h3>Purpose</h3>
<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/02/01/2021-02177/tackling-the-climate-crisis-at-home-and-abroad">E.O. 14008: Climate Crisis: Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad:</a> The US and the world face a profound climate crisis. We have a narrow moment to pursue action at home and abroad in order to avoid the most catastrophic impacts of that crisis and to seize the opportunity that tackling climate change presents. Domestic action must go hand in hand with United States international leadership, aimed at significantly enhancing global action. Together, we must listen to science and meet the moment.

<h3>Goals</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use Federal procurement to support robust climate action including a carbon pollution-free electricity sector, no later than 2035 and clean and zero-emission vehicles for Federal, State, local, and Tribal government fleets.</li>
<li>Drive the assessment, disclosure and mitigation of climate pollution and climate-related risks in every sector of our economy.</li>
<li>Promote the flow of capital towards climate-aligned investments and away for high-carbon investments.</li>
</ul>
