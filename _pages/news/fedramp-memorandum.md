description: "On October 27, 2023, The Office of Management and Budget (OMB)released a draft memorandum aimed at modernizing the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), inviting public comment on the proposal. Initially established in 2011, FedRAMP was designed to evaluate the security of commercial cloud services, enabling federal agencies to leverage these services efficiently and securely. However, the complexity and diversity of today's cloud services have outgrown the original framework of FedRAMP, necessitating an update to address the current cloud environment's challenges."
