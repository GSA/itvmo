description: let me know what you think: "In May 2021, the Biden Administration's Executive Order 14028 marked a pivotal change in U.S. federal cybersecurity strategy, emphasizing the importance of a Zero Trust security model. This approach, encapsulating the principle of "Never trust, always verify," treats no user, device, or service as inherently safe, demanding rigorous verification for every access attempt, regardless of its origin. This shift towards Zero Trust underscores a comprehensive, ongoing effort rather than a quick fix, necessitating a diverse set of technologies and practices to effectively implement a Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA)."
