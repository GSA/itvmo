description: "In May 2021, the Biden Administration issued Executive Order 14028, revolutionizing U.S. federal cybersecurity with a focus on Zero Trust security. This model, based on Never trust, always verify, mandates stringent verification for all access attempts within government networks, regardless of origin. Emphasizing a continuous, multifaceted approach, Zero Trust requires a blend of technologies and practices, marking a significant departure from traditional cybersecurity strategies towards a more secure, resilient governmental infrastructure."
