description: "The IT Governmentwide Category, in partnership with the ACT-IAC Small Business Alliance, held an Emerging Tech Small Business event on March 7, 2023. The event navigated the ever-changing federal government contract landscape by informing attendees of existing and upcoming programs and policy changes that affect all small businesses. The collaboration and thought leadership exchanged at the event provided real time information to take place between the speakers and attendees, enabling small businesses to plan for the future.
The event opened with the IT Governmentwide Category Manager, Laura Stanton, followed by Beth Killoran, GSAâ€™s Deputy CIO, who provided the keynote address. After a short break, the event held a panel discussion with agency Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBUs)."
