title: 5-Point Blueprint for Public Governance of AI
description: >-
  Brad Smith, vice chair and president of Microsoft, said there are five actions
  governments should take when addressing emerging and existing issues related
  to artificial intelligence through law, public policy and regulations and the
  first is implementing and building on new government-led AI safety frameworks.


  He cited as an example the AI Risk Management Framework launched by the National Institute of Standards and Technology.


  Another step governments should take is requiring effective safety brakes for AI platforms that control critical infrastructure, Smith wrote in a blog post published Thursday.
