00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
FedRAMP is a government-wide program that promotes the adoption of secure cloud services across the federal government

2
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.000
by providing a standardized approach to security and risk assessment for cloud technologies.

3
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:19.000
FedRAMP enables the federal government to accelerate the adoption of cloud computing by creating transparent standards and processes for security authorizations

4
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:27.000
 and allowing agencies to leverage security authorizations on a government-wide scale reducing duplicative efforts, inconsistencies, and cost inefficiencies.

5
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Since the FedRAMP Program was created in 2011, the cloud landscape has significantly changed.

6
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:46.000
Over the past 10+ years, there has been an increased adoption of cloud products and services resulting in increased efficiencies and improved accessibility while also enabling better collaboration, data management, and public engagement.

7
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:58.000
For example: By leveraging cloud infrastructure, the Government can rapidly deploy and develop new digital services and applications to meet the evolving needs of the public, without being constrained by physical infrastructure limitations.

8
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:08.000
Cloud-based applications and services can be accessed from anywhere with an internet connection, making government services more accessible to members of the public, regardless of their location.

9
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:16.000
Cloud-based tools and platforms facilitate collaboration among government agencies, departments, and personnel, enabling better information sharing and coordination.

10
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:25.000
Cloud-based analytics tools and services enable the Government to process and analyze large datasets, providing valuable insights for informed decision-making and policy development.

11
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:35.000
Cloud-based platforms and applications can enhance engagement by providing user-friendly interfaces, mobile accessibility, and real-time updates on government services and initiatives.

12
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Additionally, the growth in the number of Software-as-a-Service products provides agencies with advanced software solutions without the complexities and costs associated with traditional software deployment and maintenance.

13
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:57.000
In 2022, Congress passed the FedRAMP Authorization Act to expand FedRAMP’s reach, enhance its governance structure, and improve the authorization process for secure cloud adoption across the federal government.

14
00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.000
In 2022, Congress passed the FedRAMP Authorization Act to expand FedRAMP’s reach, enhance its governance structure, and improve the authorization process for secure cloud adoption across the federal government.

15
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.000
Key areas of the draft guidance include how the FedRAMP Program would:

16
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:12.000
Become a security-first program where the security and protection of sensitive data and systems is prioritized above all else. 

17
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:22.000
Scale the number of FedRAMP authorizations by bringing agencies together to evaluate the security of cloud offerings and strongly incentivizing reuse of one FedRAMP authorization by multiple agencies.

18
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:29.500
and Streamline the authorization process by automating FedRAMP assessments and processes, consistent with industry best practices.
