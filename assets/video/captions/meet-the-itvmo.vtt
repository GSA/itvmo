00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Hey! We’re the IT Vendor Management Office, or ITVMO for short.

2
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:13.000
We were established by the Office of Management and Budget to provide meaningful acquisition intelligence for faster, smarter IT buying decisions across the federal government.

3
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.000
Let’s talk about what we can do for you!

4
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:22.000
The ITVMO advises and advocates on behalf of agency IT buyer needs by serving them as their federal representative.

5
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.000
We’ve developed buying guides and best practices documents to support your OEM procurements.

6
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:38.500
Additionally, the ITVMO supports agency IT buyers on translating governing policies and navigating the federal marketplace, like our info sheets explaining new Executive Orders and identifying related resources.

7
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:45.500
Through the ITVMO’s Executive Steering Committee the program works with the IT Best-in-Class Vehicles to standardize requirements and increase market compliance.

8
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
We share information on the vehicles and can direct agency buyers to your program representatives.

9
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:59.000
Our network extends to provide you access to subject matter experts and resources by working across federal programs and ally organizations.

10
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:08.000
We routinely partner on events and initiatives to facilitate collaboration and solve shared challenges that improve government IT buying for stakeholders across the ecosystem. 

11
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:14.500
Finally, we partner with OEMs, Small Businesses, and new entrants to solve common challenges and improve interoperability. 

12
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Through events like our annual ITVMO Summit and regular Small Business conferences, we connect IT vendors with agency buyers.
