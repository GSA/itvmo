00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Every day, attacks on U.S. cybersecurity threaten our national security.

2
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:17.500
 These attacks are serious, and their ability to affect critical infrastructure - things like our hospitals, telecommunications, transportation, and energy - ultimately puts American lives at risk.

3
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Decades of defects in our legacy systems and aging or outdated technology have left our software vulnerable,

4
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.000
making third parties and external vendors some of the most sought-after routes of attack.

5
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
The best line of defense for the federal government and our industry partners to guard against these attacks is implementing a zero trust security model.

6
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:44.500
Zero trust security refers to the model of requiring verification from everyone trying to gain access to a system, without having any default level of trust inside or outside a network. 

7
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Importantly, this applies to the full scope of the IT supply chain and should be applied not only to the governmentâ€™s direct vendors, but also second and third order connections to government systems. 

8
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.500
Oftentimes acquisition professionals are the first line of defense in mitigating supply chain risks 

9
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:10.000
by including security clauses in contracts that require vendors to adhere to specific security standards and zero-trust principles and performing security assessments on potential vendors before awarding contracts

10
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.000
In practice, holding vendors accountable to this increased level of security has involved a wide range of policies, plans, and memos

11
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.000
designed around ensuring that the technology connected to our most critical infrastructure is safe and secure.
