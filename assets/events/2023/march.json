The Army must continue to streamline its acquisition processes, and continue to invest in the modernization of facilities and infrastructure, training, and skill sets required across the AME, with an eye towards the future, to maintain overmatch for great power competition.\n\nWith support from the Army Materiel Command, the Army Futures Command, alongside the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics and Technology) and other Army Commands, this three-day event highlights how the Total Army will modernize and transform into a multi-domain capable force.",
