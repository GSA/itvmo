The Army must continue to streamline its acquisition processes, and continue to invest in the modernization of facilities and infrastructure, training, and skill sets required across the AME, with an eye towards the future, to maintain overmatch for great power competition.\n\nWith support from the Army Materiel Command, the Army Futures Command, alongside the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics and Technology) and other Army Commands, this three-day event highlights how the Total Army will modernize and transform into a multi-domain capable force.",

            "description": "Emerging technology and innovation are needed by government from both large and small businesses.  Of particular note is the fact that many small businesses harvest emerging technology and innovation, which are considered key components in supporting the federal government with transformation.   As a Small Business, whether you are a seasoned firm or new to government contracting, your firm needs to determine whether its capabilities and skill sets align with the requirements set forth by agency contracting offices.  It is not only understanding the match, but also determining which agency is best aligned with your capabilities. Small businesses need to understand an agency's acquisition needs and requirements, their projected forecast, and their buying habits.<br>This event will include a panel of representatives from five different OSDBUs where they will share with you their top priority pipeline and forecast for the forthcoming year.  After the panel discussion, separate breakout sessions will be held by each OSDBU to discuss their specific forecast and upcoming opportunities and in turn, companies can share their corporate capabilities.  In addition, there will be several mid-sized firms who have graduated from a small business to share their growth stories.  And finally, the event will offer opportunities to network and meet possible future partners.",
