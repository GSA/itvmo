            "description": "The ITVMO is taking a more active role in the Integrated Data Collection process. As part of that effort we want to engage with Agencies after submissions have been completed and discuss challenges regarding the submission and any changes that may occur for the next submission. This is also a good opportunity to ensure transparency across the IDC process and engage Agencies to support getting more refined data. Join us from 11:00am - 12:00pm. For questions about this session or to attend please contact the ITVMO at <a href='mailto:itvmo@gsa.gov'>ITVMO@gsa.gov</a>.",
