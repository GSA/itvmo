synopsis: >-
  Government, industry and academia are actively using new or modifying existing
  digital technologies to assist with changes, improvements, and efficiencies in
  operation of the business processes, meet customer demands, utilize automation
  to reduce many manual work processes while improving productivity, and enable
  these tools to reach a wider audience by reducing geographic barriers. Digital
  Transformation can improve operational efficiencies, provide more agility and
  flexibility in day-to-day activities, enable opportunities to grow and expand,
  and provide new value, satisfaction, and benefit for not only the staff but
  also the customers and shareholders. Many have dubbed "Digital Transformation
  as Reimagining How we do Business‚Äù.\
