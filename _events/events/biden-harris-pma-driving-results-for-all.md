  The President's Management Agenda (PMA) is transforming government to better
  serve everyone. Join us for our PMA summer event, Biden-Harris PMA: Driving
  Results for All.


  The event will feature keynote remarks from Jason Miller, Deputy Director for Management at the Office of Management and Budget, followed by a series of short, engaging talks from dedicated public servants who are championing PMA priorities to build a stronger workforce, improve customer service, and strengthen how the government does business.


  Speakers from across partner agencies will discuss tangible efforts to improve customer experience through IRSâ€™ Direct File Pilot, expanding hiring through the Pathways Program, and reducing barriers for small businesses to advance equity in procurement.


  This event is an exciting opportunity to:


  Gain valuable insights on key PMA priorities.

  Learn practical implementation strategies from engaging speakers.

  Network and connect with fellow PMA supporters.

  The event will take place at the Yates Auditorium in the Department of Interior, located at 1849 C St., NW, Washington, DC 20240. A livestream will be available for virtual attendees. Please email pgovsupport@gsa.gov if you need any special accommodations.


  Together, we're creating a more effective and equitable Federal Government.
