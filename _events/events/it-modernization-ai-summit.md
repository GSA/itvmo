title: IT Modernization & AI Summit
description: >-
  Digital transformation is more essential now than ever for state and local
  governments, as well as higher education institutions. Only a few years
  removed from a period of crisis decision making and sped up timelines,
  technology leaders are continuing to chase modernization and digital expansion
  and ready to embrace the change that comes along with it.


  In addition, citizens continue to clamor for a better digital experience, meaning government agencies and universities are required to modernize and transform at the same time, all while trying to keep up with — and embrace — emerging technologies like artificial intelligence.
