  The role of AI in responding to security threats has taken on new urgency as
  agency leaders grapple with AI's emergence into mainstream business
  applications. However, threat actors are moving just as quickly to capitalize
  on AI to advance their attacks.

You'll hear from top leaders about where they're concentrating their AI efforts and gain important perspectives on how AI is being put to work in the public sector.
