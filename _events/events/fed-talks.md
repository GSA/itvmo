title: Fed Talks
description: >-
  The federal government is in the midst of a digital transformation that has
  the potential to reinvent the way agencies provide citizen services and
  perform their most essential functions. Guided by the top priorities of the
  White House, leaders across the federal government are embracing modern
  technologies like AI and the cloud, fortifying cybersecurity by shifting to
  zero-trust architectures and prioritizing user experience in digital services.
  Yet, at this transformative moment in the federal technology landscape,
  intangibles like leadership, workforce development, innovation and cultural
  management remain key to navigating the massive shifts in how agencies serve
  their missions in the digital age.
