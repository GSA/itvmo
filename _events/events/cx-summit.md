title: CX Summit
description: >-
  Every day, the Federal government delivers essential services that shape
  lives, from pivotal life moments to times of crisis. The government's reach is
  vast—driving economic prosperity, safeguarding the health and safety of
  citizens at home and abroad, and ensuring people receive the benefits they’re
  entitled to. At the heart of this operation are Federal employees, the
  backbone of these critical services, serving both internal and external
  customers.


  While digital channels are the public’s preferred way to access these services, they’re not the only avenues the government must excel in. If websites and digital tools aren’t designed for ease of use, all service channels—including contact centers and in-person support—become overwhelmed. Many government programs are complex, often requiring agency personnel to navigate multiple systems and databases to provide accurate and timely guidance.


  This is where Customer Experience (CX) strategies come into play. Designing digital experiences with CX at the core ensures that the government understands who its customers are, what they need, and whether those needs are being met. CX isn’t just a buzzword—without a customer-centric approach to modernization, agencies risk squandering taxpayer dollars and creating programs that miss the mark.
