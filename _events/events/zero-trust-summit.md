title: Zero Trust Summit
description: As federal agencies meet early deadlines for zero-trust adoption
  set in motion by the White House’s executive order on cybersecurity and
  related mandates, it's becoming clear that achieving this basic level of
  zero-trust security isn't an end state — instead, it's the first step on a
  continued journey. And, as more and more transformation and innovation are
  introduced into the federal tech marketplace, agencies now have opportunities
  to harness things like artificial intelligence, 6G wireless communication and
  new cloud-based security tools to enhance their zero-trust architectures.
