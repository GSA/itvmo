title: Government & AI Summit
description: >-
  Leveraging artificial intelligence as a powerful decision making tool
  continues to be a strategic priority for the United States. As agencies
  collect, analyze and disseminate more data than ever before, advancements in
  computing power and machine learning capabilities have created real world
  applications and success stories. And with the release of the AI Executive
  Order, federal agencies are further encouraged to develop safe, secure, and
  trustworthy uses of artificial intelligence.


  During this in-person summit, Nextgov/FCW dives deeper into the technology and key considerations experts are making for AI implementation. Weâ€™ll examine the past, present and future iterations of artificial intelligence, its benefits, success stories in implementation, and key policy considerations to ensure effective use.
