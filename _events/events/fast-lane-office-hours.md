  Schedule for Information Technology (MAS-IT) is accelerating the pace of
  government technology acquisition. We’ll explore innovative initiatives like
  the FASt Lane and Startup Springboard, which streamline the process for
  vendors to get their IT products and services to federal agencies faster.
  Discover how the FASt Lane reduces processing times for new offers and
  modifications, while the Startup Springboard enables startups to meet federal
  requirements using alternative experience criteria.
