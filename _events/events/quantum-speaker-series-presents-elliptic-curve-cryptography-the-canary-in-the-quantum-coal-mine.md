title: "Quantum Speaker Series Presents: Elliptic Curve Cryptography, the Canary
  in the Quantum Coal Mine"
description: In this presentation, we cover the latest trends in quantum
  hardware and algorithms for cryptanalysis. We review the basics of ECC and its
  deployment in digital infrastructures and locate attacks on ECC in the
  application landscape of quantum computers.

  While most forward-looking studies about cryptographically relevant quantum
  computers (CRQC) focus on the threat to factoring and the risks associated to
  securing data against harvest now, decrypt later attacks, systems reliant on
  elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) are bound to be the first vulnerable to
  quantum attacks.\

  In this presentation, we cover the latest trends in quantum hardware and algorithms for cryptanalysis. We review the basics of ECC and its deployment in digital infrastructures and locate attacks on ECC in the application landscape of quantum computers. From physical and economical considerations, we estimate a plausible range for the cost of quantum attacks and the rate at which such attacks can occur at the onset of the fault tolerant regime.
