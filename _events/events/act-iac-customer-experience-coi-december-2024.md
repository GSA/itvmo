synopsis: In this session, we will explore how federal agencies are using
  Artificial Intelligence to unlock insights in operations, customer and
  employee experience data in order to innovate service delivery, strengthen

  technologies like AI can enable Government agencies to leverage the increasing

  improve upon the effectiveness, ease, and emotional resonance of its
  operations, programs, and services that deliver care, benefits and essential
  services to the public.
