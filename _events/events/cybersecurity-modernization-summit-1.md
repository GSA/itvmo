  Even in an era of rapidly-expanding technology, cybersecurity remains among
  the biggest challenges public sector technology leaders face. State and local
  government information security leaders, as well as their counterparts at
  higher education institutions, are continuing to adapt to an ever-changing
  reality at an even faster pace.\

  \

  From defending government systems from threats produced by — and with systems augmented by — generative AI, to continued budget and workforce challenges, public sector cyber leaders are racing to stay ahead of the curve, while readying themselves to defend against an attack.\

  \

  This virtual event will bring together cybersecurity leaders to explore the ongoing challenge of cybersecurity in the state and local government and higher education communities. They will discuss the expanding threat landscape, defense tactics and intersections with other trending topics in the public sector technology community with a focus on lessons learned.
