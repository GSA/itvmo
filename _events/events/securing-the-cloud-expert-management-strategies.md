  Most security breaches happen due to poor software configuration in the cloud. As federal agencies continue to adopt commercial, off-the-shelf (COTS) and rely on open-source code libraries to innovate and modernize in the cloud – ensuring proper configuration and security practices are more important than ever.


  Join us as we delve into the world of cloud modernization – take a deep dive into exploring cloud security, configuration management, and secure cloud governance. During this webinar, you will uncover the subtilities of the cloud journey and explore how the adoption of secure-by-design principles can simplify challenges and enable flexibility.
