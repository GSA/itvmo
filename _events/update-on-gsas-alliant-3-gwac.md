title: Update on GSA's Alliant 3 GWAC
description: >-
  Since the summer of 2022, the ACT-IAC GSA FIE has been working in close
  collaboration with GSA on the Alliant 3 program. In speaking with GSA, ACT-IAC
  confirmed that the Final RFP is expected to be released in May of 2024. We
  would also like to share the following update.


  GSA has received many questions from industry as it relates to section L.5.2.4.4 of the Draft RFP which is Small Business Emerging Technology Solutions Engagement. The purpose of the Small Business Emerging Technology Solutions Engagements is to show GSA that the Alliant 3 vendors will have access to innovative small businesses, and to also help small businesses meet with Alliant 3 offerors.
