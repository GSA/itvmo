title: Navigating IT Modernization and Cloud Security
description: As federal agencies tackle the demands of integrating
  cybersecurity, cloud security, artificial intelligence, and digital services,
  they face the complex and evolving challenge of IT modernization. This process
  is critical and necessary across the Federal Government, with each agency
  undergoing its unique transformation journey. Cloud security, in particular,
  plays a pivotal role in this modernization, ensuring that sensitive data is
  protected while enabling agencies to leverage scalable and flexible cloud
  solutions. Assisting these agencies in achieving their missions through
  effective IT modernization and robust cloud security is essential. Join ATARC
  and panel experts from government and industry for this webinar discussion
  focused on how agencies are addressing IT Modernization and Cloud Security,
  the challenges agencies face when it comes to modernization, and best
  practices for migrating to the cloud successfully.
