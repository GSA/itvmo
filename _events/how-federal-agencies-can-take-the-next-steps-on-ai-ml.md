title: How Federal Agencies Can Take the Next Steps on AI/ML
description: Federal agencies and mission partners are implementing AI-infused
  solutions to support a wide range of missions. What’s next? How – and where –
  should Federal agencies integrate these disruptive and revolutionary
  technologies into their operations? How can agencies responsibly harness their
  vast potential? Join us to discuss the myriad opportunities and challenges
  presented by the growth of AI and ML, and how policy, practical experience,
  and investments in IT infrastructure and personnel can come together to help
  agencies make the best use of these powerful technologies.
