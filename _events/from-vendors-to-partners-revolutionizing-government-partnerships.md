title: "From Vendors to Partners: Revolutionizing Government Partnerships"
description: >-
  Kyra M. Stewart, Governmentwide IT Vendor Management Office Program Manager at
  U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) and Leading for IMPACT Award
  Recipient will share how transitioning vendor relationships to partnerships
  has helped advance efforts to elevate the Customer Experience at the
  Governmentwide ITVMO.                       


  During this informative conversation, we'll plumb Ms. Stewart's thoughts on: the growing emphasis on customer experience in federal acquisitions and how itâ€™s changing the nature of doing business with the government, the challenges and benefits of moving from a transactional relationship to  an industry-agency partnership for a seamless customer experience, and  how a whole-of-government approach founded on these partnerships creates a more equitable, secure marketplace that improves overall government effectiveness.
