title: "Challenges and Approaches: Improving Federal IT Audit Readiness and Outcomes"
description: "Federal agencies have to undergo independent audits to demonstrate
  compliance with Federal IT audit controls from guidelines such as Federal
  Information System Controls Audit Manual (FISCAM), Federal Information
  Security Modernization Act (FISMA), Statement on Standards for Attestation
  Engagements (SSAE), Financial Improvement and Readiness Guidance (FIAR),
  National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) guidance, as well as
  other Federal audits and general Federal IT Controls. Agencies often struggle
  to achieve a state of readiness for these audits in terms of minimizing IT
  findings, improving FIAR compliance, and gaining an understanding of options
  for remediation of IT findings resulting from the audit. "
