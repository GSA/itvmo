title: Journey Mapping for Cloud Migration Acquisition Session
description: >-
  Learn a tool that can help you take the best approach to buying cloud for your
  agency. 


  Cloud Migration means moving data, applications, and services from a legacy mainframe infrastructure to the cloud.


  Has your agency decided to buy cloud? Are you thinking about migrating? 


  Moving to the cloud offers multiple benefits – less debt, lower hardware procurement costs, and increased system flexibility, resiliency and automation – but you may have a lot of questions about buying it. How the government buys cloud migration services is crucial to the success of the agency’s cloud adoption. 

  Does your agency follow best practices for cloud migration acquisition? Are you aware of all the pain points in the process?

  Journey mapping can assist! In this workshop, you’ll use a journey map to explore the often complex process of Cloud Migration Acquisition. We’ll step you through the process, let you practice, and with a sample map invite you to envision how it could work for your agency. 


  Participants will receive a workbook that includes the materials offered in the workshop – applicable cloud migration requirement documents such as PWS, RFQ, and QASP. etc. 


  What is a journey map?


  A journey map is a powerful tool that teams use to visualize the steps necessary to successfully execute their project. Typically, the process includes:


  -Various stages of an effort or steps a person takes

  -Key activities, tasks, and deliverables involved in each stage

  -Pain points and challenges

  -Metrics or other data that can help track progress and success


  This workshop is presented by the Acquisition practice and the Cloud/Infrastructure Optimization of the Center of Excellence (CoE) and is offered at no cost to federal employees, as part of Resources and Advisory Support.
