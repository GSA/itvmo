title: Journey Mapping for Cloud Migration Acquisition Session
description: >-
  Has your agency decided to buy cloud? Are you thinking about migrating? 


  Cloud Migration – moving data, applications, and services from a legacy mainframe infrastructure to the cloud – offers multiple benefits – less debt, lower hardware procurement costs, flexibility, resiliency and automation. But you may have a lot of questions about buying it.  Maybe you didn’t have a chance to attend in March of this year when it was first offered?


  Does your agency implement best practices? Are you aware of all the pain points in the process?


  Journey mapping can assist! In this workshop, you’ll use a journey map to explore the often complex process of Cloud Migration Acquisition. We’ll step you through the process, let you practice, and with a sample map invite you to envision how it could work for your agency. 


  Participants will receive a workbook that includes the materials offered in the workshop – applicable cloud migration requirement documents such as PWS, RFQ, and QASP. etc. 


  What is a journey map?


  A journey map is a powerful tool that teams use to visualize the steps necessary to successfully execute their project. Typically, the process includes:


  -Various stages of an effort or steps a person takes

  -Key activities, tasks, and deliverables involved in each stage

  -Pain points and challenges

  -Metrics or other data that can help track progress and success
