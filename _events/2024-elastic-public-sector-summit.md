description: >-
  Government agencies are confronting a new era of challenges in extracting
  value from their data. As the volume and velocity of data from mission and
  operations, cybersecurity systems, IoT and edge devices, cloud application
  traces, and now generative AI keep growing, agency leaders need more effective
  ways to capitalize on the value of all that data.


  Join top federal program executives and IT leaders and learn firsthand how advances in data management, search, and analytics capabilities are helping agencies turn data into mission value faster and more productively for citizens and government employees. And learn how agencies are leveraging these capabilities for cybersecurity, operational resilience, and preparing for the new era of generative AI.
