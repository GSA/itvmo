title: Data In Action Summit
description: >-
  As government agencies of all kinds adopt the strategies necessary to shape
  their citizen services into streamlined platforms, leaders are increasingly
  turning to data as both a reference point for success and a technology
  apparatus for affecting change. In taking what was once a useful tool and
  making it an essential part of the complex modernization process, data and the
  tools used to analyze it has become invaluable for IT officials looking to
  create a government as effective as it is transparent, and to see its work in
  action.


  But none of this is possible without modernized infrastructure, strong security protocols, and a clear vision for the road ahead. As citizen demands evolve, how can governments ensure the work they’re doing is as safe as it is productive? What can public and private sector officials learn from each other as they implement these new emerging technologies? And what challenges lie ahead to seeing data, and the results it brings, in action?


  Join GovExec and Informatica in conversation with public sector experts on how they're using data to deliver transformative analysis, security, and CX solutions across their agencies.


  Attendees will walk away from this event with a better understanding of:


  The strategic applications of data in the public sector

  How government entities can leverage data to optimize CX 

  Data’s critical role in defending system security

  The guiding impact of data on AI and automation
