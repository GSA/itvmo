title: "Data Forum: Empowering Mission Excellence"
description: >-
  Data is a key mission driver. There is no effective AI without good data.
  ‘Good’ here encompasses all the practices needed to maximize the use of data
  for the mission. These include data ingest and management, data security,
  making sense of data through analytics, and secure sharing of data products.
  Organizations that treat data as an asset rather than an expense are best
  positioned to unleash its potential. This forum will discuss how best to
  ensure that data functions as a center of gravity to meet and exceed mission
  objectives.


  The Data Forum this year will be done in collaboration between ACT-IAC and the Data Foundation.
