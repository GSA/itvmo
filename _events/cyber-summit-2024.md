title: Cyber Summit 2024
description: >-
  Facing attacks of increasing scope, scale, and frequency, today’s public
  sector cybersecurity leaders are challenged like never before. As they work
  tirelessly to defend their networks and systems, it’s essential for today’s
  cyber decision makers to remain mindful of broader trends and capabilities
  that could help them improve their posture. From establishing and
  incorporating zero trust strategies to exploring ways to improve identity
  management and acting on other administration mandates, today’s cyber
  landscape is vast and the work is never done. 


  Join Nextgov/FCW and Route Fifty for this virtual program featuring leading officials from federal agencies and state and local governments to share best practices and success stories and explore the next generation of cybersecurity in the public sector.
