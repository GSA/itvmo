title: "Securing Success: RMF and Zero Trust Unleashed"
description: >-
  Our digital world is more expansive than ever before, giving access to
  unprecedented capabilities for our business, government, and personal use. As
  digital transformation accelerates, the risks associated with cyberattacks
  grow and affect every aspect of modern business, from customer service to
  government operations to smart infrastructure. Cyber or Business resilience
  must be a critical component of all security strategies — yet it is often
  regulated as a security or an IT problem and not an operational one.


  The reality is that cybercriminals are more sophisticated than ever before, meaning that the ability to defend, respond, and recover from a cyber event requires support across the organization. Neither IT nor security can cope alone. This panel will discuss the importance of resilience in today’s digital world and examine how to build a foundation for effective risk management throughout organizations.
