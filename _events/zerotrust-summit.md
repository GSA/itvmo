title: ZeroTrust Summit
description: >-
  Advances in AI-assisted technologies and the growing sophistication of
  international threat actors are increasing the stakes for federal agencies to
  implement new and more effective safeguards to protect the nation’s strategic
  data. Much of that effort revolves around the Biden administration’s Executive
  Orders on National Cybersecurity and related mandates coming due in 2024 to
  adopt zero-trust architectures across their enterprises. Don’t miss this
  important annual gathering of federal government and industry thought leaders
  as they share their practical experiences and strategies in laying the
  foundations for and establishing the major pillars of zero-trust
  cybersecurity.


  Learn how agencies are implementing advanced identity and access management platforms, taking new steps to protect their networks and their data, and capitalizing on the latest cloud security applications. Join top cybersecurity decision-makers and take advantage of opportunities to network with peers, industry experts, and government leaders to help accelerate your agency's cybersecurity efforts.
