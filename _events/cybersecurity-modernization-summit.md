title: Cybersecurity Modernization Summit
description: >-
  Cybersecurity continues to be one of the biggest challenges public sector
  technology leaders face. In an industry that moves so fast and affects so
  many, state and local government information security leaders, as well as
  their counterparts at higher education institutions, are continuing to adapt
  to an ever-changing reality.


  From new threats ushered in from generative AI, to workforce challenges, to a constant need for additional funding, cybersecurity leaders need to continue to stay ahead of the curve, while being prepared to defend their systems in the event of an attack.


  This virtual event will bring together cybersecurity leaders to explore the ongoing challenge of cybersecurity in the state and local government and higher education communities. They will discuss the ongoing battle in embracing AI, while protecting critical infrastructure and constituent data with a focus on lessons learned.
