title: AI within the Government (HHS)
description: >-
  The landscape of AI has shifted from theoretical principles to the practical
  question of responsible implementation. The conversation will address the
  evolving regulatory landscape, emphasizing the transition from if AI to how do
  we do it responsibly. Notably, the discussion will explore commercial
  information bought by the government, especially concerning privacy, as
  highlighted in recent executive orders.


  We will navigate the intricate balance between AI technology and ethical considerations. As AI increasingly integrates into our lives, the panel will spotlight the healthcare sector, emphasizing the urgency of ethical guidelines and responsible development.
