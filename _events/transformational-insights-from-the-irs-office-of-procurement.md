  opportunity to reshape and transform the enterprise with tens of billions of
  new funding. IRS Procurement Operations serves as a key delivery partner in
  achieving these objectives. Please join us as we preview major enterprise-wide
  acquisitions planned for this fiscal year and beyond as the Office of the
  Chief Procurement Officer (OCPO) modernizes Procurement across IRS. There will
  also be a panel discussion detailing Procurement Operations' support for the
  IRS's Transformation & Strategy Roadmap; the future vision for the office; and
  how industry can support the agency achieve its objectives. "
