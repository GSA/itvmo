description: "The harnessing of the right cyber power is more important than ever in a domain deluged by persistent attacks and simultaneous sophisticated campaigns that threaten global political, economic and security interests. A flagship event, AFCEA’s TechNet Cyber serves as a center of gravity for a whole-of-government effort to bring together the policy, strategic architecture, operations and C2— along with the joint capabilities—needed to meet the global security challenges and successfully operate in a digital environment. Join us in Baltimore and be a part of the conversation led by U.S. Cyber Command, DISA, the DoD CIO, and numerous industry and academia partners to deliver solutions for this enduring, no-fail mission."
