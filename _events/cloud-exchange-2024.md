title: Cloud Exchange 2024
description: >-
  June marks the five-year anniversary of the Office of Management and Budget’s
  release of the Cloud Smart strategy. The shift to moving workloads and
  applications to the cloud when it makes sense strategically – versus keeping
  some things on premise or standing up hybrid environments – is playing out in
  every agency’s IT modernization strategy.


  Over the course of two afternoons, Federal News Network will explore civilian agency progress in using the cloud to improve digital services and federal missions. On Day 1, we will focus on the need for secure digital services and the evolution of policies and processes to achieve trusted services. On Day 2, we will share real-world case studies that spotlight successes in using cloud to impact mission effectiveness.
