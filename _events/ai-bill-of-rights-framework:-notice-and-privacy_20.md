organizer: "ATARC"
url-link: "https://atarc.org/event/ai-bill-privacy/"
description: "In October 2022 the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) released their “Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights”, intended to inform and shape the development of federal AI policy. In response, ATARC is hosting a series of webinar panels to promote discussion and provide clarity on the Blueprint’s structure and goals.
These panels will bring together government leaders, academics, and researchers, with the hope that these discussions will further the effective implementation of US federal AI policy. Our second panel discussing the Blueprint will focus on the “Notice” and “Privacy” Pillars.
