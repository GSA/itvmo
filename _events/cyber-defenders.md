title: Cyber Defenders
description: >-
  Cybersecurity is a cornerstone of the Biden administration’s priorities and
  has never been more important to securing the nation’s infrastructure and data
  from cyber threats than it is today. Government IT leaders must remain
  vigilant against near-constant cyber threats while maintaining legacy systems
  and securing a remote workforce. 


  In this workshop, Nextgov/FCW will examine the most important trends in cybersecurity across the federal government. We’ll explore everything from handling ransomware, hybrid work and the use of personal devices to advancements in identity management and identifying foreign cyber threats. As we do so, we’ll be joined by government leaders at the forefront of cyber workforce training and acquisition. Join us as we navigate the cutting edge tactics and solutions in cyber defense. 


  Attendees will walk away from this event with a better understanding of:


  What a robust cybersecurity framework looks like in the public sector.


  The guiding impact of federal legislation on government cybersecurity.


  How government IT leaders can meet the evolving needs of a cyber workforce.


  Strategies for overcoming cybersecurity challenges, including proactive approaches to mitigating cybercrime.
