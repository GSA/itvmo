title: "VISION 2030: The Federal Tech Revolution"
description: >-
  Vision 2030 Forum will be a half-day working session to help navigate
  disruptions in Government. As defined, a technological disruption occurs when
  a new piece of technology, called disruptive technology, changes the way
  consumers, business and industries operate, usually have attributes that are
  recognizably superior, and generate new markets.


  This event will provide a dynamic space for government and industry visionaries to co-create groundbreaking solutions for tomorrow's challenges. The interactive, disruptive sessions will feature breakout groups led by government and industry trailblazers tackling use cases in a variety of topics with AI and Chat GPT serving as research assistants throughout the event. Vision 2030 will guide you based on the use case, persona, and problem statement you select, sparking intentional disruption while identifying unexpected risks to government and society. Expect unprecedented interactivity and insight that will not only provoke thought but also generate actionable ideas that are desirable, feasible, and viable. To capture the essence of our discussions, a graphic artist will be on hand to visually document the eventâ€™s highlights.
