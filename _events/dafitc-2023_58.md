description: "The Department of the Air Force Information Technology and Cyberpower Education & Training Event will be held in Montgomery, AL from August 28-30, 2023
In 2022, thousands of Air Force peers, along with private sector leaders in the IT and cyber security field convened to network, discuss, connect and learn about the newest and most prevailing threats to our global networks and national defense. With 205+ breakouts, a trade show with over 175 vendor booths, and nearly 4000 attendees, speakers, and exhibitors, DAFITC came roaring back with its first in-person event in two years, and 2023 is poised to grow even more.
In 2023 you can expect to hear from leading voices in the public and private sectors, hearing a range of ideas, opinions, and assessments of the current state of all things cyber as well as insights into what the keys to future success might look like.
With this year’s theme, Digitally Transforming the Air & Space Force: Investing for Tomorrow’s Fight, DAFITC 2023 will examine the ever-changing ways in which big data and emerging cyber technologies are reshaping the landscape in which we live."
