title: AI Acquisition Forum
description: >-
  Generative Artificial Intelligence and Emerging Technologies have entered the
  government procurement environment and from everyoneâ€™s perspective these
  technologies are here to stay. These newer technologies enable us to
  re-imagine service delivery and provide more efficient operations; however,
  there are still concerns about ethical and legal implications, intellectual
  property rights, data and privacy protection, and more. Acquisition staff need
  to have a better understanding of what these tools are, how these tools are
  used, and how they impact the acquisition process. Of importance is
  understanding how these tools are bought and sold in the commercial market and
  how they are used in acquisition organizations to promote efficiencies. 


  This forum will provide subject matter experts from both government and industry to de-mystifying the hype around these technologies and further enable more collaboration, communication, and mutually common definitions to make the procurement process an easier and more timely endeavor.
