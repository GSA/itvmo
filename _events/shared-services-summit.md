title: Shared Services Summit
description: >-
  The Shared Services Summit will provide updates from key government agencies,
  international organizations, FedRamp, and large national organizations that
  have enacted a shared services enterprise using Generative AI and other
  technologies in the process. The intent of this Summit is to provide
  registrants with new ideas, concepts, structures, and designs for shared
  services that work successfully in organizations and/or internationally and to
  review new steps, ideas, and recommendations for the new administrationâ€™s
  consideration during the 2024-2025 transition process. 


  The Shared Services Summit is a collaboration between ACT-IAC and Shared Services Leadership Coalition.
