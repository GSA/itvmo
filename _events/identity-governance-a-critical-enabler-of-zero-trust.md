  organizational resources to promote mission accomplishment while mitigating
  risk. This webinar will focus on the opportunities and current challenges in
  using identity governance approaches to enable the achievement of zero trust
  cybersecurity goals. Panelists will discuss the current or envisioned use of
  identity governance methods and tools within their organization and share
  lessons learned for the identity pillar on their journey towards zero trust.
