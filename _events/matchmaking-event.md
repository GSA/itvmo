  Delaware have joined forces to organize a Matchmaking Event, which serves as a
  platform for businesses to connect with representatives from Federal and state
  Agencies, and Prime Vendors. This event offers an excellent opportunity for
  small, new, minority, women, veteran, and disabled person-owned businesses to
  engage in one-on-one meetings with Prime Vendors and Federal and State
  agencies, all in a single event. This is an ideal occasion for those
  businesses seeking to understand the process of establishing business
  partnerships with Federal, State Agencies, and Prime Vendors who are actively
  seeking subcontractors.
