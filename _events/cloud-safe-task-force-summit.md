title: Cloud Safe Task Force Summit
description: >-
  Recent alarming cyber breaches on government IT infrastructure perpetrated by
  state actors, have significantly escalated concerns regarding Cloud Ecosystem
  security. These breaches have exposed critical cyber resilience deficiencies,
  especially in certification processes and dealing with known vulnerabilities.
  This event serves as a crucial platform for both US Government leadership and
  Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) to join in developing a unified response for
  Government.


  In response to rising needs, a collaborative initiative of independent experts served as the catalyst for this event. With the goal of aligning efforts and forging a resilient path forward, this initiative ensures that the nationâ€™s critical digital infrastructure remains secure in the face of relentless cyber threats.
