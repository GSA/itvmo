title: Cybersecurity Summit 2023
description: CISA is responsible for managing sixteen critical infrastructure
  sectors whose assets, systems, and networks whether physical or virtual, are
  considered to be extremely vital to the United States.  If any of these
  systems or networks are weakened or destroyed, it would have a very
  devastating impact on the security, national economic security, and/or
  national public health or safety. The Summit will address several of the
  critical infrastructure sectors on what is being done to mitigate the risk and
  protect the security of our Nation.  In addition, the Summit will provide a
  special dedication and awards ceremony to the winners of the U.S. Cyber
  Challenge.
