title: Supply Chain Workshop 2024
description: >-
  Proper supply chain management and national security concerns have never been
  more interconnected. As geopolitical tensions bring cyber threats to the fore,
  the public and private sector must collaborate to ensure each link of the
  supply chain is secure. And everyone in the organization, from developers to
  senior leadership, must prioritize risk management across the entire threat
  landscape. 


  Because cybersecurity risks can arise at any point in the life cycle or any link in the supply chain, having full visibility, clear standards, and no single point of failure is critical. Government-wide standards, frameworks, and third-party certifications are important tools to begin securing potential attack surfaces, but what other steps can agencies take to tackle the complexity of supply chain security? During this virtual workshop, Nextgov/FCW will convene government and industry leaders to discuss practical steps in expanding supply chain visibility, leveraging policy directives, and implementing zero trust practices across the entire supply chain.
