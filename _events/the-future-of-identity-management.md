title: The Future of Identity Management
description: >-
  Federal agencies face a growing number of internal and external threats to
  their networks, making modern identity management and cybersecurity practices
  critical linchpins to protecting government data.


  How are federal leaders looking to improve upon existing multifactor authentication options and experimenting with advanced phishing-resistant multifactor authentication that moves beyond the PIV Card? And how are agencies preparing to meet other aggressive cybersecurity requirements laid out by the Biden administration, including the mandated switch to zero trust architecture by late 2024?


  Join Nextgov/FCW & GovExec for this event outlining what you need to know about how federal agencies are looking to modernize identity management practices.
