title: FED Talks
description: >-
  The federal government is in the midst of an ongoing digital transformation
  that has the potential to reinvent the way agencies provide citizen services
  and perform their most essential functions. Guided by the top priorities of
  the White House, leaders across the federal government are embracing modern
  technologies like generative AI and the cloud, fortifying cybersecurity by
  shifting to zero-trust architectures and embracing post-quantum cryptography,
  and prioritizing user experience in digital services. Yet, at this
  transformative moment in the federal technology landscape, intangibles like
  leadership, workforce development, innovation and cultural management remain
  key to navigating the massive shifts in how agencies serve their missions in
  the digital age.
