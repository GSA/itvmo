title: AI Acquisition Forum
description: "Use of AI in government agencies requires that agencies manage the
  risks and performance and implement structures to govern and manage the
  process of acquiring AI. This was addressed by OMB in Advancing the
  Responsible Acquisition of Artificial Intelligence in Government (M-24-18).
  The latest Executive Order is on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development
  and Use of Artificial Intelligence to strengthen AI safety, security, equity,
  privacy, promote innovation and more. This forum is designed to update the
  audience on the new OMB AI Procurement, how is the government addressing the
  Generative AI responses to procurements, and the status and updates of the
  procurement staff as they address the requirements and responses to proposals.
