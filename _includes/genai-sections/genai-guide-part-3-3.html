<h2 class="itvmo-article-sub-2 no-top">3.3 Solutions Scoping and Testing</h2>
<p>
  It’s often difficult to know which Generative AI tool will be best for your
  agency’s purposes. That’s why it’s helpful to try them out first. In
  coordination with agency officials with relevant expertise and
  responsibilities, the Integrated Product Team (IPT) can see which tools have
  the right combinations of functions and features that work with the data the
  agency has and help get to the goals the agency wants to achieve.
</p>

<h3 class="itvmo-article-sub-3-blue">
  3.3.1 Categories of Generative AI Solutions
</h3>
<p>
  By knowing what the agency’s priority problems are, and focusing on how
  Generative AI tools might address those needs, the IPT can scout potential
  Generative AI solutions. To jumpstart an agency’s reporting needings, perhaps
  tools that can analyze and generate first-draft text can help. If the agency
  is having a hard time keeping up with public inquiries, perhaps they need
  Generative AI-enabled chatbots that can retrieve specific information that an
  agency has uploaded in the LLM.
</p>

<p>
  The IPT can identify potential categories of solutions, which functions and
  features are needed to address the agency’s priority problems and initial
  performance requirements.
</p>

<p>
  For a starter list of Generative AI solutions categories, consider the typical
  Generative AI tools shown in

<h3 class="itvmo-article-sub-3-blue">3.3.2 Cloud Platform Sandboxes</h3>
<p>
  No two Generative AI systems work exactly the same. What a supplier says their
  product can do might be close to what your agency wants or needs but may
  require tweaks to really make them work. At the same time, Generative AI
  systems are also evolving rapidly. Functions that don’t exist now might be
  available later.

    >OMB Management Memo M-24-10</a
  >
  provides a helpful reference about what sort of AI-enabling infrastructure
  and/or testing might best inform this process.
</p>

<p>
  Testing solutions before doing a full-scale purchase can help ensure the
  Generative AI products meet your specific agency’s needs. The IPT can then
  translate their experiences testing solutions into requirements and use cases
  for an acquisition plan and contract documents that will meet their goals.
</p>

<p>
  “Sandboxes” are test beds that agencies can use to experiment with Generative
  AI tools. Think of them as low scale versions of tech you are exploring. These
  sandboxes allow users to try different tools and identify which ones work best
  for your agency’s needs. They can also help more accurately estimate the
  amount of effort and cost it might take to complete the project.
</p>

<p>
  A subset of the IPT can bring their expertise in data, workflows and security
  to scope the sandbox and begin running tests with data and different
  Generative AI tools, subject to legal and policy restrictions and with
  appropriate safeguards.
</p>

<p>
  In many cases, the IPT can create a sandbox on a cloud platform that allows
  them to upload their data and try different Generative AI modules to see what
  kinds of results each gives. Because most Generative AI tools are available
  through cloud platforms this is an easy and relatively quick way to get
  started.
</p>

<p>
  Consider what data would be appropriate to use in a testing environment and
  what restrictions may apply to certain kinds of data (e.g., personally
  identifiable information, confidential business information, etc.) including
  certain restrictions on publicly available data. Working with agency officials
  with relevant expertise and responsibilities to address a system’s privacy and
  data security risks and incorporate appropriate safeguards (e.g., through an
  ATO process or FedRAMP certification) is an important part of this process.
</p>

<div class="indent-article-section-1">
  <h4 class="itvmo-article-sub-4">Multiple Sandboxes</h4>
  <p>
    Some IPTs may even decide to set up multiple sandboxes on a few different
    cloud platforms so they can test which modules work best for the agency’s
    needs and which platforms offer the most flexibility, lowest cost and best
    return on investment. Because each cloud platform and module works
    differently, be cautious and conduct individual security and privacy reviews
    for each sandbox before putting data into each sandbox.
  </p>

  <h4 class="itvmo-article-sub-4">Setting Up Sandboxes</h4>
  <p>
    Typically setting up and using these sandboxes can happen under the
    Simplified Acquisition Threshold (SAT) since they are used for small scale
    experiments. The IPT can create sandboxes using current contracts with a
    Value Added Reseller (VAR). The IPT may have to go through extra steps to
    access third party products through your sandbox. You may need to update or
    include new terms and conditions with the vendor. Consider creating a
    concept of operations (CONOPS) or charter with your agency’s CIO, CAIO and
    CISO organizations to operate these. Sandboxes that do not use certain types
    of data (for example, government data) and are not connected to the agency
    network may allow for flexibility to experiment with new software quickly.
  </p>

  <h4 class="itvmo-article-sub-4">Performance Metrics and Evaluation</h4>
  <p>
    To get the most useful feedback about the Generative AI tool, test their
    performance in conditions that mirror how the tool will be deployed in the
    real world. The IPT can create metrics and evaluation criteria for testing
    and assessing the performance of solutions at any dollar threshold. If the
    tool will be used by the public or non-technical staff, the IPT may want to
    also conduct basic user experience, usability and accessibility testing of
    the tool across a range of devices (desktops, laptops, tablets and
    smartphones).
  </p>
</div>

<h3 class="itvmo-article-sub-3-blue">3.3.3 Non-Cloud Platform Sandboxes</h3>
<p>
  Some tools may not be available through a traditional cloud platform. Working
  with the Generative AI tool vendor to use a trial version or create a custom
  sandbox for your agency might be needed. As with other testbeds, always make
  sure to check with your agency’s CIO, CISO, CAIO and OGC to ensure that the
  tools comply with all relevant security and privacy laws and policies.
</p>

<p>
  The IPT may opt to test “self-hosted” tools that sit on the agencies’ own IT
  infrastructure and use “open source” models that are widely available rather
  than closed, proprietary systems. These options can offer the agency greater
  control over the Generative AI tools and may save costs paid to external
  providers but may require more internal resources to manage. Because such open
  source software is used by many different players, there are many
  opportunities to put in “backdoors” where data can be accessed or siphoned off
  without the users knowledge so security scans and monitoring are critical.
</p>

<h3 class="itvmo-article-sub-3-blue">
  3.3.4 Specifying Generative AI Solutions
</h3>
<p>
  With some sense of what combinations of platform and Generative AI tools work
  for the data the agency has and the outcomes it wants, the IPT can determine
  what the agency will need to acquire.
</p>

<p>
  The agency may require access to a new cloud platform or to change the terms
  of use for an existing platform. The IPT may decide it needs to have access to
  several different Generative AI tools. The experiments they ran in the sandbox
  may show the need for several accounts to scale up operations. Engineers may
  decide that they want to be able to integrate Generative AI functions into
  their own systems and need access to software interfaces that allow them to
  exchange data with other applications, commonly known as an “API” or an
  Application Programming Interface.
</p>

<p>
  Determine the products and services that the IPT needs to succeed, the
  quantities, the performance requirements and any other specifications needed
  to write a clear statement about what the agency is interested in purchasing.
  If the IPT has specific requirements that only certain products will meet,
  start to develop the appropriate justification and associated authority based
  on the documented need to limit competition supported by the results of the
  IPT’s initial experiments.
</p>

<h3 class="itvmo-article-sub-3-blue">3.3.5 Advanced Generative AI Options</h3>

    Sandbox tests and other considerations may show that the IPT requires more
    sophisticated Generative AI capabilities. They may want to:

        Fine-tune a Pre-Trained Model
      </h4>
      <p>
        LLMs rely on algorithms where different connections and information are
        given more or less “weight” or significance. Fine tuning is a process of
        changing those weights so different information is treated as more or
        less important.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li class="bulletText">
      <h4 class="no-top itvmo-article-custom-bullet-header">
        Customize a Pre-Trained Model
      </h4>
      <p>
        LLMs are trained on a certain set of initial data. The LLM can be
        customized further with more up-to-date information or information
        relevant to a specific field which makes it significantly more useful or
        even links to searchable databases.

        Train and Fine-Tune a Model
      </h4>
      <p>
        A team may decide that they want to take the basic architecture and
        algorithms of an LLM and train it on completely different data and weigh
        the information in a very specific way. This can give a specialized
        result meant for a particular purpose.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li class="bulletText">
      <h4 class="no-top itvmo-article-custom-bullet-header">Build a Model</h4>
      <p>
        A team may want to develop everything themselves from the ground up,
        crafting their own algorithms, determining their own weights of what
        information is more important and training it with its own data. This is
        a significant lift but may be necessary for very specific uses such as
        high-security applications.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Typically these kinds of projects require greater effort, expertise, data
    security and privacy monitoring and oversight so IPTs should think deeply
    about the investment and whether the agency truly requires it.
