</p>

<p>
  With the IPT having defined the agency’s goals, tested Generative AI solutions
  in sandboxes, developed requirements and defined how data will be managed, you
  can map out what you intend to buy and how you intend to buy it. You can
  specify the performance metrics of the Generative AI products, tools,
  functions, modules or add-ons that will best serve the agency based on the
  sandbox tests the IPT completed. There are multiple ways to answer the
  question of “how to buy it.”
</p>

<h3>3.5.1 The fastest acquisition may be no new acquisition.</h3>
<p>
  Generative AI tools are often software delivered via the web or “Software as a
  Service” (SaaS). So like other SaaS tools most Generative AI tools are easily
  available through cloud platforms, other software packages and
  publicly-available websites.
</p>

<p>
  Generative AI tools may already be available to agency staff. They might have
  them in tools they already use every day. Generative AI tools may be
  accessible through existing government cloud platforms. And they may be
  available through professional service and system integrator contracts
  agencies already have in place.
</p>

<p>
  That means your agency might be able to access Generative AI solutions without
  doing a new acquisition.
</p>

<p>
  In that way, the fastest acquisition for Generative AI tools may be no new
  acquisition, or as simple as adding “credits” to an existing cloud platform
  contract to account for the new requirements or resources associated with the
  Generative AI tools.
</p>

<p>
  Of course the fastest or easiest solutions may not be the best for the agency
  in the short and/or long term. Work with the IPT to manage issues of
  competition and vendor lock in.
</p>

<p>
  Before embarking on a large scale or involved process for scoping and
  conducting a new acquisition for Generative AI tools, see if there is a
  simpler route. Work with your agency’s Chief Information Officer, Chief
  Artificial Intelligence Officer and Chief Information Security Officer to
  determine what you already have in place and whether you can just use an
  existing solution or contract.
</p>

<p>Here are a few options:</p>

<h4>From public web tools you can access</h4>
<p>
  Many providers offer basic Generative AI tools and services from a freely
  available public page or a search page. If your agency staff’s Generative AI
  needs are basic, consider using one of these basic, free tools. This might
  only be acceptable in very few use cases. Also note that use of free public
  tools will likely limit the data you can use and the amount of information
  available to address some of the risks and concerns identified in previous
  sections, so carefully consider these limitations before use. Review the terms
  of service with your agency’s legal team before using these tools to ensure
  compliance.
</p>

<h4>In software you have</h4>
<p>
  Lots of software packages have basic Generative AI functionality built in.
  Before you start a new acquisition, check with your agency’s IT group. You may
  already have access to the right Generative AI tools within your existing
  software.
</p>

<h4>Via a cloud platform you use</h4>
<p>
  Many cloud platforms and “hyperscalers” provide access to Generative AI tools
  as modules from right within their platforms. Agency staff might be able to
  use their current cloud platform accounts and credits to pay for and use those
  modules if it is within the scope of the underlying, pre-existing contract.
</p>
<h5>Best Practices when Accessing Generative AI Tools via a Cloud Platform</h5>
<ul>
  <li>
    Get formal risk management approval from the OCIO, CISO, CAIO and OGC. The
    EO stipulates AI use cases need to be risk managed by contract authorities
    or agency IT. If there is not yet a formalized process, document your
    approvals from the relevant agency officials.
  </li>
  <li>
    Consider creating a concept of operations (CONOPS) or charter with your
    agency’s CIO, CAIO and CISO organizations to operate these.
  </li>
  <li>
    Identify which cloud platforms your agency has access to, which office(s)
    own the contracts and what the terms and conditions are. In many cases, the
    contract and contracting officer are assigned to the CIO organization.
  </li>
  <li>
    Prioritize security even for experiments. Choose cloud platforms and modules
    that have received FedRAMP authorizations. Understand how your data may be
    used to train the model or improve outputs, with and without your consent.
  </li>
  <li>
    Develop a cost estimate based on the pricing in the contract. If the
    contract is with a Value Added Reseller, there may be management costs for
    the vendor in addition to the credits needed to stand up the environment.
  </li>
  <li>
    Ensure you are getting access to the right version of the platforms. Many
    cloud platforms have different versions for commercial and government each
    with special security options and pricing models. You may also need to
    request permission to access Generative AI modules if there are only test
    versions available for federal environments.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>
  From a professional services provider or IT system integrator on contract
</h4>
<p>
  A growing number of consultants are offering Generative AI access through
  their existing professional services contracts. IT system integrators have
  also built Generative AI tools and interfaces to others’ tools. Agency staff
  can sometimes access such tools through a custom portal or from software that
  the consultant or SIs have deployed. Depending on their contract and task
  order, a consultant or SI might already be able to provide or build a custom
  solution to provide access to Generative AI tools.
</p>

<p>
  With any of the above options, keep in mind that even though you might not do
  a new acquisition you may still need to modify the terms and conditions of an
  existing contract, obligate funds to buy more credits or upgrade subscriptions
  or exercise an option.
</p>

<p>
  And of course, especially for what looks to be “free,” check with your
  agency’s Chief Information Officer, Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer and
  Chief Information Security Officer to ensure the tools meet all appropriate
  regulations, standards and policies.
</p>

<h3>3.5.2 Acquisition Channels for Generative AI</h3>
<p>
  If you need to do an acquisition to access Generative AI tools a few options
  exist. The acquisition method or vehicle you choose may influence which of
  these options is most appropriate. As with any acquisition, existing providers
  should be a consideration and not a requirement that impedes competition
</p>

<h4>
  Acquire access to Generative AI tools or functions within software you already
  have.
</h4>
<p>
  Typically the acquisition process for getting these Generative AI features
  will look like paying more for a higher subscription or to move up to the next
  feature tier that has the more expensive functions. If you procure that
  software through a Value Added Reseller (VAR) there may be a management fee in
  addition to the cost of Generative AI tools access.
</p>

<p>
  Note that many software providers are adding Generative AI capabilities into
  existing software. Ensuring you review any changes to the functionality or the
  terms and conditions will help you to identify whether these capabilities are
  present in new software updates and deliveries.
</p>

<h4>Acquire access to Generative AI tools directly from the manufacturer.</h4>
<p>
  The acquisition process will probably look like paying the manufacturer
  according to their pricing structures. The manufacturer may use a Value Added
  Reseller (VAR) who may charge a management fee in addition to the cost of
  Generative AI tools access.
</p>
<h4>
  Acquire access to a cloud platform and Generative AI tools through that
  platform.
</h4>
<p>
  The acquisition process should involve procuring access to the cloud platform
  and then paying for using the Generative AI tools. Many of the cloud platforms
  use resellers who may charge a management fee in addition to the cost of
  Generative AI tools access.
</p>
<h4>Acquire access to Generative AI tools through a system integrator.</h4>
<p>
  System integrators all have different pricing models but you can expect to
  find many that bill as professional services by the hour, week or month. They
  may charge separately for Generative AI tools access.
</p>
<p>
  Many Generative AI tool manufacturers use multiple channels for their
  products. They sell their tools directly, they use resellers and they make
  their tools available through cloud platforms and system integrators. Often
  the prices vary among the channels – in some cases you have to pay if you go
  to the manufacturer but you can get limited uses of products for free through
  partners.
</p>

<p>
  Look carefully at the different acquisition options and determine what best
  meets your agency’s needs. Identify which options offer…
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The trackable, transparent and cost-effective pricing models</li>
  <li>
    The flexibility and scalability for changing users, usage or use cases
  </li>
  <li>The terms and conditions for proper security and data management</li>
  <li>The ease for agency staff to access and use the tool</li>
  <li>The speed of acquiring access once the solicitation is released</li>
</ul>

<h4>Custom Solutions</h4>
<p>
  In certain cases, the IPT may decide it needs more than just access to
  Generative AI tools and actually needs a custom solution that is tailored or
  built specifically for their use. Such acquisitions may end up looking like
  other purpose-built software purchases in pricing, terms and conditions and
  process.
</p>

<h3>3.5.3 Acquisition Vehicle Selection</h3>
<p>
  You can choose from many options of acquisition vehicles, including
  governmentwide acquisition contracts. This guide includes a list of potential
  acquisition vehicles available for civilian agencies. Some vehicles will be a
  better fit for your agency’s particular needs. A few questions to ask as you
  evaluate which acquisition vehicle might be best to use for your needs:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Does your agency have an anticipated contract type?</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Your agency may prefer or need to use a certain type of contract. There are
  multiple contract types outlined in
  <a
    class="usa-link usa-link--external"
    href="https://www.acquisition.gov/far/part-16"
    >FAR Part 16</a
  >
  such as fixed price, cost reimbursement and time and materials. Not every
  acquisition vehicle can accommodate all contract types. It is important to
  research whether the anticipated contract type aligns with a specific vehicle.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is the acquisition vehicle designated Best-in-Class?</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Your agency may benefit from using acquisition vehicles that have been
  designated Best-in-Class (BIC) by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).
  BIC vehicles maximize the government’s shared purchasing power, allowing
  agencies to leverage volume discounts; help agencies operate more efficiently
  by reducing administrative costs and contract duplication; and expand sharing
  of government-wide buying data, leading to better-informed decisions.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Does your agency have specific socio-economic requirements or targets?
    <br />
    Your agency may plan to set-aside a contract requirement to target certain
    socioeconomic categories such as Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (VOSBs) or
    those in the 8(a) Business Development program. Some vehicles provide easy
    ways to access such suppliers.
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    Does your agency have budget/resource constraints?
    <br />
    Your agency may need to keep to a strict dollar limit for a purchase. Some
    vehicles have negotiated better prices or fees in exchange for the buying
    agency taking on more of the burden of the acquisition from reporting to
    compliance checks.
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Does your agency have preferred or approved vehicles?</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Your agency may have identified particular contracts as part of its strategic
  sourcing efforts that it prefers to use. Some vehicles may be designated as
  preferred or even mandatory vehicles because they meet your agency priorities
  and not using these vehicles would require a waiver.
  <br />
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Does your agency have its own capacity to verify compliance?
    <br />
    Your agency may prefer to not worry about reviewing or verifying whether
    suppliers are in compliance with relevant policies and regulations. Some
    vehicles have pre-negotiated terms and conditions that ensure suppliers
    comply with such rules.
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    Are the products or services you need available on the vehicle you plan to
    select?
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Your agency may have very specific requirements for the solutions they are
  trying to procure. Some vehicles may have the right suppliers or products
  available while others do not.
</p>

<p>See Section 4 for a list of relevant acquisition methods and vehicles.</p>
