</p>

<p>
  With the IPT having documented the agency’s goals, tested Generative AI
  solutions in sandboxes, developed requirements and worked with relevant agency
  officials to define how data will be managed, you can map out what you intend
  to buy and how you intend to buy it. You can specify the performance metrics
  of the Generative AI products, tools, functions, modules or add-ons that will
  best serve the agency based on the sandbox tests the IPT completed. There are
  multiple ways to answer the question of “how to buy it.”
</p>

<h3 class="itvmo-article-sub-3-blue">
  3.5.1 The fastest acquisition may be no new acquisition.
</h3>
<p>
  Generative AI tools are often software delivered via the web or “Software as a
  Service” (SaaS). So like other SaaS tools most Generative AI tools are easily
  available through cloud platforms, other software packages and publicly
  available websites.
</p>

<p>
  Generative AI tools may already be available to agency staff. They might have
  them in tools they already use every day. Generative AI tools may be
  accessible through existing government cloud platforms. And they may be
  available through professional service and system integrator contracts
  agencies already have in place.
</p>

<p>
  That means your agency might be able to leverage existing enterprise wide
  solutions to access Generative AI solutions instead of purchasing a new
  product.
</p>

<p>
  In that way, the fastest acquisition for Generative AI tools may be no new
  acquisition, or as simple as adding “credits” to an existing cloud platform
  contract to account for the additional requirements or resources associated
  with the Generative AI tools. Verify the additional requirements are within
  scope for the existing contract.
</p>

<p>
  Of course the fastest or easiest solutions may not be the best for the agency
  in the short and/or long term. Work with the IPT in the market research phase
  to ensure adequate competition is anticipated to avoid vendor lock in.
</p>

<p>
  Before embarking on a large scale or involved process for scoping and
  conducting a new acquisition for Generative AI tools, see if there is a
  simpler route. Work with your agency’s Chief Information Officer, Chief
  Artificial Intelligence Officer, Chief Data Officer, Chief Information
  Security Officer, Senior Agency Official for Privacy and other relevant
  officials to determine what you already have in place and whether you can just
  use an existing solution or contract.
</p>

<h4 class="itvmo-article-sub-4">Here are a few options:</h4>

<div class="indent-article-section-1">
  <h4 class="itvmo-article-sub-4">From public web tools you can access</h4>
  <p>
    Many providers offer basic Generative AI tools and services from a freely
    available public page or a search page. If your agency staff’s Generative AI
    needs are basic, consider using one of these basic, free tools. This might
    only be acceptable in very few use cases. Also note that use of free public
    tools will likely limit the data you can use and the amount of information
    available to address some of the risks and concerns identified in previous
    sections, so carefully consider these limitations before use. Review the
    terms of service and any fiscal law implications with your agency’s legal
    team before using these tools to ensure compliance.
  </p>

  <h4 class="itvmo-article-sub-4">In software you have</h4>
  <p>
    Lots of software packages have basic Generative AI functionality built in.
    Before you start a new acquisition, check with your agency’s IT group. You
    may already have access to the right Generative AI tools within your
    existing software. Expanding access to or leveraging built in capabilities
    may require review of the existing agency Authority to Operate (ATO) and the
    boundaries for the current operating state.
  </p>

  <h4 class="itvmo-article-sub-4">Via a cloud platform you use</h4>
  <p>
    Many cloud platforms that offer large scale data storage and compute power
    provide access to Generative AI tools as modules from right within their
    platforms. Agency staff might be able to use their current cloud platform
    accounts and credits to pay for and use those modules if it is within the
    scope of the underlying, pre-existing contract.

          stipulates AI use cases need to be risk managed by contract
          authorities or agency IT. If there is not yet a formalized process,
          document your approvals from the relevant agency officials.
        </li>

        <li class="bulletText">
          Consider creating a concept of operations (CONOPS) or charter with
          your agency’s CIO, CAIO and CISO organizations to operate these.
        </li>

        <li class="bulletText">
          Identify which cloud platforms your agency has access to, which
          office(s) own the contracts and what the terms and conditions are. In
          many cases, the contract and contracting officer are assigned to the
          CIO organization.
        </li>

        <li class="bulletText">
          Prioritize privacy and security including for experiments. Choose
          cloud platforms and modules that have received FedRAMP authorizations
          and incorporate appropriate safeguards to mitigate risks. Understand
          how your data may be used to train the model or improve outputs, with
          and without your consent.
        </li>

        <li class="bulletText">
          Develop a cost estimate based on your requirements. One way to do that
          is to use publicly available price data from the cloud service
          providers you are considering . If the contract is with a Value Added
          Reseller, there may be management costs for the vendor in addition to
          the credits needed to stand up the environment.
        </li>

        <li class="bulletText">
          Ensure you are getting access to the right version of the platforms.
          Many cloud platforms have different versions for commercial and
          government each with special security options and pricing models. You
          may also need to request permission to access Generative AI modules if
          there are only test versions available for federal environments.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>
  <h4 class="itvmo-article-sub-4 mt-0">
    From a professional services provider or IT system integrator on contract
  </h4>
  <p>
    A growing number of consultants are offering Generative AI access through
    their existing professional services contracts. IT system integrators have
    also built Generative AI tools and interfaces to others’ tools. Agency staff
    can sometimes access such tools through a custom portal or from software
    that the consultant or SIs have deployed. Depending on their contract and/or
    task order, a consultant or SI might already be able to provide or build a
    custom solution to provide access to Generative AI tools. Anything outside
    the contract provisions and clauses may incur additional cost and
    requirements.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  With any of the above options, keep in mind that even though you might not do
  a new acquisition you may still need to modify the terms and conditions of an
  existing contract, obligate funds to buy more credits or upgrade subscriptions
  or exercise an option.
</p>

<p>
  And of course, especially for what looks to be “free,” check with your
  agency’s Chief Information Officer, Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer,
  Chief Data Officer, Chief Information Security Officer, Senior Agency Official
  for Privacy, and other relevant officials to ensure the tools meet all
  appropriate regulations, standards and policies.

<h3 class="itvmo-article-sub-3-blue">
  3.5.2 Acquisition Channels for Generative AI
</h3>
<p>
  If you need to do an acquisition to access Generative AI tools a few options
  exist. The acquisition method or vehicle you choose may influence which of
  these options is most appropriate. As with any acquisition, existing providers
  should be a consideration and not a requirement that impedes competition.
</p>

<div class="indent-article-section-1">
  <h4 class="itvmo-article-sub-4">
    Acquire access to Generative AI tools or functions within software you
    already have.
  </h4>
  <p>
    Typically the acquisition process for getting these Generative AI features
    will look like paying more for a higher subscription or to move up to the
    next feature tier that has the more expensive functions. If you procure that
    software through a Value Added Reseller (VAR) there may be a management fee
    in addition to the cost of Generative AI tools access.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b> Note:</b>b> that many software providers are adding Generative AI
    capabilities into existing software. Ensuring you review any changes to the
    functionality or the terms and conditions will help you to identify whether
    these capabilities are present in new software updates and deliveries.
  </p>

  <h4 class="itvmo-article-sub-4">
    Acquire access to Generative AI tools directly from the manufacturer.
  </h4>
  <p>
    The acquisition process will probably look like paying the manufacturer
    according to their pricing structures. The manufacturer may use a Value
    Added Reseller (VAR) who may charge a management fee in addition to the cost
    of Generative AI tools access.
  </p>
  <h4 class="itvmo-article-sub-4">
    Acquire access to a cloud platform and Generative AI tools through that
    platform.
  </h4>
  <p>
    The acquisition process should involve procuring access to the cloud
    platform and then paying for using the Generative AI tools. Many of the
    cloud platforms use resellers who may charge a management fee in addition to
    the cost of Generative AI tools access.
  </p>
  <h4 class="itvmo-article-sub-4">
    Acquire access to Generative AI tools through a system integrator.
  </h4>
  <p>
    System integrators all have different pricing models but you can expect to
    find many that bill as professional services by the hour, week or month.
    They may charge separately for Generative AI tools access.
  </p>
  <p>
    Many Generative AI tool manufacturers use multiple channels for their
    products. They sell their tools directly, they use resellers and they make
    their tools available through cloud platforms and system integrators. Often
    the prices vary among the channels. In some cases you have to pay if you go
    to the manufacturer but you can get limited uses of products for free
    through partners.
  </p>

  <p>
    Look carefully at the different acquisition options and determine what best
    meets your agency’s needs. In accordance with governmentwide and agency
    regulations and policies, consider as part of your requirements development
    which options offer…

    </ul>
  </div>

  <h4 class="itvmo-article-sub-4">Custom Solutions</h4>
  <p>
    In certain cases, the IPT may decide it needs more than just access to
    Generative AI tools and needs a custom solution that is tailored or built
    specifically for their use. Such acquisitions may end up looking like other
    purpose-built software purchases in pricing, terms and conditions and
    process.

    href="https://www.acquisition.gov/far/part-13"
    >FAR Part 13</a
  >
  below are a few questions to ask as you evaluate which acquisition vehicle
  might be best to use for your needs:
</p>

<div class="bulletSections mb-0">
  <div class="topLine"></div>
  <ul class="experiences">
    <li class="bulletText">
      <h4 class="no-top itvmo-article-custom-bullet-header">
        Does your agency have an anticipated contract type?
      </h4>
      <p>
        Your agency may prefer or need to use a certain type of contract. There
        are multiple contract types outlined in
        <a
          class="usa-link usa-link--external"
          href="https://www.acquisition.gov/far/part-16"
          >FAR Part 16</a
        >
        such as fixed price, cost reimbursement and time and materials. Not
        every acquisition vehicle can accommodate all contract types. It is
        important to research whether the anticipated contract type aligns with
        a specific vehicle.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li class="bulletText">
      <h4 class="no-top itvmo-article-custom-bullet-header">
        Is the acquisition vehicle designated Best-in-Class?
      </h4>
      <p>
        Your agency may benefit from using acquisition vehicles that have been
        designated Best-in-Class (BIC) by the Office of Management and Budget
        (OMB). BIC vehicles maximize the government’s shared purchasing power,
        allowing agencies to leverage volume discounts; help agencies operate
        more efficiently by reducing administrative costs and contract
        duplication; and expand sharing of government-wide buying data, leading
        to better-informed decisions.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li class="bulletText">
      <h4 class="no-top itvmo-article-custom-bullet-header">
        Does your agency have specific socio-economic requirements or targets?
      </h4>
      <p>
        Your agency may plan to set-aside a contract requirement to target
        certain socioeconomic categories such as Service Disabled Veteran-Owned
        Small Businesses (SDVOSBs) or those in the 8(a) Business Development
        program. Some vehicles provide easy ways to access such suppliers.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li class="bulletText">
      <h4 class="no-top itvmo-article-custom-bullet-header">
        Does your agency have budget/resource constraints?
      </h4>
      <p>
        Your agency may need to keep to a strict dollar limit for a purchase.
        Some vehicles have negotiated better prices or fees in exchange for the
        buying agency taking on more of the burden of the acquisition from
        reporting to compliance checks.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li class="bulletText">
      <h4 class="no-top itvmo-article-custom-bullet-header">
        Does your agency have preferred or approved vehicles?
      </h4>
      <p>
        Your agency may have identified particular contracts as part of its
        strategic sourcing efforts that it prefers to use. Some vehicles may be
        designated as preferred or even mandatory vehicles because they meet
        your agency priorities and not using these vehicles would require a
        waiver.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li class="bulletText">
      <h4 class="no-top itvmo-article-custom-bullet-header">
        Does your agency have its own capacity to verify compliance?
      </h4>
      <p>
        Your agency may prefer to not worry about reviewing or verifying whether
        suppliers are in compliance with relevant policies and regulations. Some
        vehicles have pre-negotiated terms and conditions that ensure suppliers
        comply with such rules.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li class="bulletText">
      <h4 class="no-top itvmo-article-custom-bullet-header">
        Are the products or services you need available on the vehicle you plan
        to select?
      </h4>
      <p>
        Your agency may have very specific requirements for the solutions they
        are trying to procure. Some vehicles may have the right suppliers or
        products available while others do not.
