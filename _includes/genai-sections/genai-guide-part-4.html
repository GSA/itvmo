  4. Acquisition Methods and Vehicles
</h1>

<p>
  There is currently not a governmentwide Generative AI-only acquisition
  vehicle. That said, the federal government has a variety of procurement
  options to help agencies purchase Generative AI solutions.
</p>

<p>
  An agency may have its own specific Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) or other
  contractual agreement that permits them to procure Generative AI solutions. If
  such a BPA exists for your agency, consider using it.
</p>

<p>
  Below is a list of some procurement options that you may wish to consider as
  you are planning your acquisition. When it comes time to buy Generative AI
  solutions, look at governmentwide Best-in-Class (BIC) acquisition vehicles as
  opportunities for best pricing and terms and conditions. Balance BIC use along
  with small business considerations.
</p>

<p>
  While open market buys of Generative AI are possible and many agencies have
  done them, they can involve higher risks from financial to compliance. When an
  agency can meet its needs using governmentwide contracts that mitigate risks
  and leverage the government’s buying power, this approach is preferred.

  The

    href="https://www.gsa.gov/technology/it-contract-vehicles-and-purchasing-programs/multiple-award-schedule-it"
    >Multiple Award Schedules (MAS) IT</a
  >
  (what used to be called “Schedule 70”) provides easy ways to purchase over 7.5
  million innovative commercial products, services, and solutions from thousands
  of pre-qualified vendors, including ones offering Generative AI solutions. MAS
  IT is managed by General Services Administration (GSA).
</p>

<p>
  Because MAS IT has a large vendor base it is best for commercial items and/or
  if you need to meet socioeconomic small business goals. MAS IT vendors have
  also gone through an initial series of compliance checks and pre-negotiated
  pricing reducing the workload on agency contracting officials. If you have a
  well-defined requirement and market research indicates that a commercial
  Generative AI tool can fulfill your need, the MAS IT vehicle may be a good fit
  for your procurement.
</p>

<h2 class="itvmo-article-sub-2 no-top">Government Wide Acquisition Vehicles</h2>
<p>
  Government-Wide Acquisition Contracts (GWACs) provide access to a wide range
  of IT solutions, including AI technologies. These contracts streamline the
  procurement process and offer competitive pricing.
  <a
    class="usa-link usa-link--external"
    href="https://www.gsa.gov/technology/it-contract-vehicles-and-purchasing-programs/governmentwide-acquisition-contracts"
    >To use GWACs</a
  >, Contracting Officers can request delegated procurement authority or work
  with groups like

    href="https://nitaac.nih.gov/resources/videos/introduction-nitaac-assisted-acquisitions"
    >NIH NITAAC’s Assisted Acquisitions team</a
  >. Working with assisted acquisition teams may incur costs in addition to
  contract access fees.
</p>

<p>
  These vehicles offer a commitment to meet customer needs, easy access to
  solutions, cost savings, socio-economic goals, streamlined acquisitions, and
  compliance with federal regulatory guidance (e.g., FedRAMP). Below are the
  major government-wide contract vehicles that would be most useful for
  Generative AI purchases:

            Pilot IRS is an iterative procurement technique focused on outcomes
            that allows the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to test new
            technologies on faster timelines. If a solution fails to meet
            expectations, then it will not proceed to the next phase of funding.
            This methodology creates an agile approach to identify, test, and
            deploy solutions that support the mission, regardless of whether the
            solution, technology, or service currently resides within the IRS or
            the federal government. The Pilot IRS program allows for testing to
            be done in phases, concurrently with other vendors, and can easily
            be scaled and ultimately deployed in incremental phases. Pilot IRS
            could potentially be used for Generative AI projects. Please check
            with Pilot IRS staff for more specific information.

  Cooperative Research and Development Agreements
</h2>
<p>
  Generally, a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) authorizes
  federal labs to enter into agreements with other federal agencies, state/local
  government, industry, non-profits, and universities for licensing agreements
  for lab developed inventions or intellectual property to commercialize
  products or processes originating in federal labs. In some cases, partnerships
  may be made directly with commercial R&D organizations. This approach may be
  most suitable if a government lab and their commercial partners either are
  developing or have developed a Generative AI tool that fits the needs of your
  agency. While no government funds can directly be provided under this
  approach, collaborating with private sector entities can provide access to
  cutting-edge Generative AI technologies and expertise, offering a path to
  innovative solutions. For more information, please review
  <a
    class="usa-link usa-link--external"
    href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=29&f=treesort&num=1958"
    >15 USC 3710a: Cooperative research and development agreements</a
  >.
</p>

<h2 class="itvmo-article-sub-2 no-top">Interagency Agreement</h2>
<p>
  Interagency agreements are authorized by the Economy Act, which allows
  agencies to enter into agreements to obtain supplies or services from another
  agency. This approach may be most practical for situations where another
  agency already has a Generative AI solution or solution set that meets your
  needs and has the ability for additional agencies to use that solution. For
  more information, please review
  <a
    class="usa-link usa-link--external"

</p>

<h2 class="itvmo-article-sub-2 no-top">Other Transaction Authority (OTA)</h2>
<p>
  Some agencies have the authority to enter into a non-FAR based legal agreement
  called an Other Transaction Authority (OTA) that leverages commercial buying
  practices. Typically OTAs are utilized to procure state-of-the-art technology
  solutions from non-traditional vendors. OTAs generally can be used for
  research and development activities, prototyping, and in certain cases
  production of prototypes. For Generative AI solutions, this may be a good
  solution to help a non-traditional vendor modify a commercial product to
  government specifications, reach smaller or niche companies with specific
  generative AI expertise, or more quickly develop an agency specific Generative
  AI capability. Your agency must have specific statutory authority to use OTA
  arrangements.
</p>

<h2 class="itvmo-article-sub-2 no-top">Commercial Solutions Opening (CSO)</h2>
<p>
  CSOs are similar to Broad Agency Announcements (BAAs) which are used for
  Research and Development (R&D); however, CSOs are set up for innovative
  commercial solutions. Typically a phased acquisition approach is used where a
  problem statement is provided by the government through a Statement of
  Objectives (SOO) and vendors submit white papers on their approach to solve
  the problem. After a technical evaluation and based on funding requirements,
  prototypes and simulations are funded and potentially follow-on contracts.
  Consider using a CSO to generate new ideas and concepts and obtain an
  innovative solution using generative AI when shorter evaluation timelines and
  rapid selection of innovative commercial solutions are necessary and when
  proposals with varying technical/scientific approaches are anticipated. Your
  agency must have specific statutory authority to use CSO arrangements.
</p>

<h2 class="itvmo-article-sub-2 no-top">Prize Competitions</h2>
<p>
  One way that agencies can begin to explore harnessing Generative AI is through
  prize based competitions.
  <a class="usa-link usa-link--external" href="http://challenge.gov"
    >Challenge.gov</a
  >
  is a central hub for prize competitions across the U.S. federal government.
  Through this platform and others, federal agencies can engage public solvers
  in prize competitions and crowdsourcing campaigns to identify innovative
  solutions to important issues. A prize competition may be appropriate if you
  are hoping to engage a diverse set of solvers, and if you would prefer to
  reward research outcomes rather than fund research inputs. You may wish to
  consider using a Prize Competition if you can:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>clearly explain the problem to be solved,</li>
  <li>outline the parameters of a successful outcome, and</li>
  <li>determine how to measure the submissions and declare a winner.</li>
</ul>
