        An Overview
      </h2>
      <p class=" ">
        On October 27, 2023, The Office of Management and Budget (OMB)released a draft memorandum aimed at modernizing the <b>Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP)</b>, inviting public comment on the proposal. Initially established in 2011, FedRAMP was designed to evaluate the security of commercial cloud services, enabling federal agencies to leverage these services efficiently and securely. However, the complexity and diversity of today's cloud services have outgrown the original framework of FedRAMP, necessitating an update to address the current cloud environment's challenges.
      </p>
      <p class=" ">
        The draft guidance proposes a comprehensive plan to scale FedRAMP, enhance its security review processes, and facilitate the faster adoption of secure cloud products and services within the federal government. This initiative builds on recent efforts, including the <b>FedRAMP Authorization Act</b> passed in 2022 and the establishment of the Federal Secure Cloud Advisory Committee. The proposed changes aim to make FedRAMP more responsive to the evolving cloud marketplace, ensuring federal agencies can access a broader range of cloud-based services. This modernization effort is expected to reduce the technological footprint of agencies, streamline government services, and improve public access to these services.
      </p>
      <p class=" ">
        <b>OMBâ€™s draft outlines four key areas of outcome for FedRamp Modernization:</b>
        <ul>
          <li>Become more responsive to the risk profiles of individual services, as well as evolving risks throughout the cyber environment.</li>
          <li>Increase the quantity of products and services receiving FedRAMP authorizations by bringing agencies together to evaluate the security of cloud offerings and strongly incentivizing reuse of one FedRAMP authorization by multiple agencies.</li>
          <li>Streamline the authorization process by automating appropriate portions of security evaluations, consistent with industry best practices.</li>
          <li>Improve sharing of information with the private sector, including about emerging threats and best practices.</li>
        </ul>

This includes scaling the program to accommodate the dramatic increase in diversity and number of cloud services, ensuring that federal agencies can leverage the latest cloud technologies efficiently and securely.</li>
            <li class="bulletText"><b>Enhanced Security and Streamlined Processes:</b> The proposed guidance focuses on strengthening FedRAMP's approach to security reviews and streamlining the authorization process. This includes automating parts of the security evaluations consistent with industry best practices and being more responsive to the risk profiles of individual services and the changing cyber environment. The goal is to increase the quantity of products and services receiving FedRAMP authorizations and encourage the reuse of authorizations across multiple agencies.</li>
            <li class="bulletText"><b>Increased Collaboration and Transparency:</b> The modernization effort seeks to improve collaboration between the government and the private sector, enhancing the sharing of information about emerging threats and best practices. It also aims to promote a transparent and consistent process for issuing security authorizations for cloud services, thereby driving better cybersecurity and innovation across the federal government.</li>
