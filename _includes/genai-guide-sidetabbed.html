          <h3>This guide focuses on Generative AI not all of AI</h3>
          <p>
            Artificial Intelligence or “AI” is one of the most profound
            technological shifts in a generation or more. At its roots, AI is
            software. That means it follows the same acquisition policies and
            rules as other software and IT as a whole.
          </p>
          <p>
            Contracting officers should consider cybersecurity, supply chain
            risk management, data governance and other standards and guidelines
            just as they would with other IT procurements.
          </p>
          <p>
            AI is also a very large space and Generative AI is just one type of
            AI. This guide focuses on Generative AI acquisition in particular
            and not AI acquisition as a whole.
          </p>
          <p>
            Look for definitions for both Artificial Intelligence and Generative
            Artificial Intelligence in Section 1.1.
          </p>

          <h3 id="audience">Assisting the Acquisition Workforce</h3>
          <p>
            This guide is primarily meant for the acquisition workforce
            navigating the complexities of acquiring Generative AI technologies
            in collaboration with relevant agency officials from other domains.
          </p>
          <p>
            This guide is focused on civilian agencies’ Generative AI needs.
            Defense, National Security and the
            <a
              class="external_link"
              href="https://dpcld.defense.gov/Portals/49/Documents/Civil/eo-12333-2008.pdf"
              >Intelligence Community</a
            >
            have very specific needs and procurement solutions that have been
            tailored for their requirements.
          </p>
          <p>
            Generative AI can be difficult to understand both for technologists
            and non-technologists.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a member of the acquisition workforce, it is critical to work
            with technical subject matter experts (SMEs) like software
            engineers, data scientists, security and privacy specialists;
            program staff who can identify the problems they are trying to
            solve, validate users’ needs, safeguard data and establish product
            goals or requirements; and agency officials responsible for
            security, privacy and other relevant disciplines to meet a range of
            agency responsibilities in this context.
          </p>
          <p>
            While those in the acquisition community don’t need to become
            experts in AI, a basic understanding of certain Generative AI terms,
            common issues and ways to derisk acquisitions will help you make
            better decisions about what to buy and how.
          </p>
          <p>
            This guide also simplifies complex technical IT and AI concepts to
            make them easier for non-technologists to understand. In some cases,
            this guide may over-simplify concepts for the sake of clarity. Seek
            support from AI, IT and data professionals when making decisions..
          </p>
          <p>
            Because Generative AI is relatively new and evolving quickly, it’s
            early to designate “best practices.” Think of the information in
            this resource guide as prompts to consider and frame your thinking
            and approach rather than directive recommendations for what to do.
            This content is non-binding. The recommendations presented do not
            supersede, modify, or direct an interpretation of existing
            requirements mandated by law or governmentwide policy.
          </p>
          <h3>The fastest acquisition may be no new acquisition.</h3>
          <p>
            Generative AI tools are often software delivered via the web or
            “Software as a Service” (SaaS). Generative AI tools may already be
            available to agency staff. They might have them in tools they
            already use every day. Generative AI tools may be accessible through
            existing government cloud platforms. And they may be available
            through professional service and system integrator contracts
            agencies already have in place.
          </p>
          <p>
            In that way, the fastest acquisition for Generative AI tools may be
            no new acquisition, or as simple as adding “credits” to an existing
            cloud platform contract to account for the new requirements or
            resources associated with the Generative AI tools.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before embarking on a large scale or involved process for scoping
            and conducting a new acquisition for Generative AI tools, see if
            there is a simpler route. Work with your agency’s Chief Information
            Officer, Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer and Chief Information
            Security Officer to determine what you already have in place and
            whether you can just use an existing solution or contract.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course the fastest or easiest solutions may not be the best for
            the agency in the short and/or long term. Work with the IPT to
            manage issues of competition and vendor lock in.
          </p>

            <h3>Artificial Intelligence</h3>
            <p>15 U.S.C. 9401(3) defines “Artificial Intelligence” as:</p>
            <p>
              “a machine-based system that can, for a given set of human-defined
              objectives, make predictions, recommendations, or decisions
              influencing real or virtual environments. Artificial intelligence
              systems use machine- and human-based inputs to perceive real and
              virtual environments; abstract such perceptions into models
              through analysis in an automated manner; and use model inference
              to formulate options for information or action.”
            </p>

            <p>
              More simply, it refers to the science and engineering of making
              intelligent machines.

            </p>
            <p>
              “the class of AI models that emulate the structure and
              characteristics of input data in order to generate derived
              synthetic content. This can include images, videos, audio, text,
              and other digital content.”
            </p>

            <p>
              Fundamentally, this is software that can generate images, video,
              audio, text and computer code when prompted by a human user.

            </p>
            <p>
              “a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network
              access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g.,
              networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can
              be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort
              or service provider interaction.”
            </p>

            <p>
              In simple terms, the “cloud” is the interconnected network of
              servers in data centers where information, data, and software are
              stored and accessed.
            </p>

            <h3>Credits</h3>
            <p>
              “Credits” is a term often used in cloud computing to describe
              currency or funds that can be used on the cloud provider’s site.
              They operate sort of like tickets at a fair where it takes 5
              tickets to go on some rides and 10 tickets to go on others. For
              cloud or Generative AI tools when you fund a particular
              requirement, you are in essence buying “credits” with your
              obligation which are then used to pay for how much computing you
              use for your requirements. If you save a lot of files to your
              cloud account you pay more credits. Each time you use a Generative
              AI tool you may pay a few credits. If you use a Generative AI tool
              to create content, they may charge you more credits for more
              sophisticated outputs.

              syntax and is accessible from application programs or user code to
              provide well-defined functionality.”
            </p>

            <p>
              Simply, APIs are digital communication tools that allow two pieces
              of software to easily exchange data with one another.

            <h2>1.2 A Basic Overview of Generative AI</h2>

            <p>
              Here is a simplified crash course into Generative Artificial
              Intelligence or “Generative AI.”
            </p>

            <h4>
              Predictive Text is a Simple Example of Artificial Intelligence
            </h4>
            <p>
              We’ve all seen the basic version of artificial intelligence in
              computers and smartphones.
            </p>

            <p>
              When we are writing an email or composing a text message the
              software suggests what the next word we might want to type is.
              That “type ahead” feature is an example of basic artificial
              intelligence in action.
            </p>

            <p>
              Predictive text relies on the most fundamental building block of
              Generative AI tools, called “foundation models.” Simply put these
              models are pieces of software that represent the way we as humans
              think as hundreds of lines of computer code, data and algorithms.
            </p>

            <p>
              Predictive text uses one of these foundation models to predict
              your next word based on what most people have written and what
              you’ve written in other sentences.
            </p>

            <h4>The Rise of Large Language Models</h4>
            <p>We can now go much farther than simple predictive text.</p>

            <p>
              That’s because in the last few years we’ve created more
              sophisticated artificial intelligence models. These new models
              have learned how we construct sentences, paragraphs and longer
              pieces of writing.
            </p>

            <p>
              The creators of these models gathered trillions of pieces of
              written language, from encyclopedia entries and literature to
              social media posts and song lyrics. They used all that data to
              “train” their models.
            </p>

            <p>
              Those humans wrote computer code and “algorithms” that looked at
              every word and phrase and analyzed how they connect to one
              another: What do those words mean? Which words tend to show up
              near others? What words are used in which contexts?
            </p>

            <p>
              The algorithms looked for patterns and statistics in the
              interrelationships of words and phrases. And the software kept
              track of the results.
            </p>

            <p>
              All of that together created a powerful kind of foundation model
              called a “Large Language Model” or LLM.
            </p>

            <h4>Artificial Intelligence that Generates Content</h4>
            <p>
              The human software programmers also figured out how to build those
              LLMs to get really good at responding to simple human questions
              and prompts. The LLMs could interpret the language a person
              inputted, analyze what it should do and provide a response.
            </p>

            <p>
              So they built chat interfaces similar to text messages that allow
              someone to write a simple prompt or question and have the tool
              respond.
            </p>

            <p>
              The tool wouldn’t just search all the trillions of pieces of
              written language information in its memory and serve up potential
              answers. It would actually use its pattern analysis of language to
              compose new phrases and sentences and give an answer. The
              artificial intelligence system would generate content; hence,
              Generative AI.
            </p>

            <p>
              Another benefit of the chat interface has been that someone could
              ask the system to improve the output in specific ways: make the
              tone more friendly, use fewer bullets, say more about this
              specific issue referencing the events of the last few months. In
              this way, humans can keep shaping and refining the output from
              Generative AI systems. And after a few rounds of refinement, we
              can get something very close to what we want.
            </p>

            <p>
              (Note: Large Language Models nowadays are often called Generative
              Pre-Trained Transformers or GPTs. Pairing a “Chat” function with a
              “GPT” is what gave the popular Generative AI product its name.
              While GPTs and LLMs are technically different, you can think of
              them as about the same for the purpose of Generative AI
              acquisition.)
            </p>

            <h4>Beyond Text</h4>
            <p>
              From there companies and researchers started creating other kinds
              of foundation models and teaching them to learn how to analyze and
              find patterns in different inputs.
            </p>

            <p>
              People started feeding the new models photographs and paintings,
              songs and speeches, videos and animation, computer code and
              numerical data. And the models learned how these kinds of content
              worked.
            </p>

            <p>
              With a similar chat-based interface it became pretty easy to now
              ask for more than a written text response. Now these foundation
              models could generate images, music, movies, and smartphone apps.
            </p>

            <p>
              As time goes on and models get better, the ability of these
              artificial intelligence tools to generate more sophisticated
              content has only increased.
            </p>
            <h2>1.3 Potential Benefits of Generative AI</h2>

            <p>
              Generative AI offers a range of potential benefits including the
              ones below. This is not an exhaustive list. New benefits are being
              discovered continually.
            </p>

            <h4>Create and Refine Content</h4>
            <p>
              Probably the biggest value that Generative AI tools offer is the
              ability to create text, pictures, sounds, videos and even computer
              code.
            </p>

            <p>
              A Generative AI tool will mine the information available in its
              training data or on the internet, much like a search engine, then
              combine it with its own pattern-making to construct sentences,
              paragraphs, graphics, and other outputs.
            </p>

            <p>
              Users then have the ability to shape, refine, and adjust the
              outputs to make them what users want and need. This allows a user
              to make rough prototypes, first drafts, and initial passes at
              content very quickly then spend time editing, curating, adjusting,
              and refining rather than having to create from a blank page.
            </p>

            <h4>Easy, Chat-Based Interface for Prompts</h4>
            <p>
              Generative AI systems typically respond to questions and requests
              that a person types into a chat or text box. The Generative AI
              tools then create text, pictures, sounds, or videos to respond to
              those “prompts.”
            </p>

            <p>
              The person can then refine and improve the output by typing more
              specific directions or guidance into the prompt box and the
              Generative AI tool can iterate what it created to better suit what
              the person wants.
            </p>

            <p>
              Interestingly, there is a growing area of expertise called “prompt
              engineering” describing people’s skills in crafting the right
              words, context, examples, and guidance to type into chat
              interfaces to iterate and get the right output from different
              Generative AI systems.
            </p>

            <h4>Customize How They Work</h4>
            <p>
              Generative AI tools often allow both programmers and end users to
              alter them. People can train a model using different data so it
              can learn the patterns of specific kinds of information. This can
              be especially useful if an organization wants to use the
              Generative AI tool for a specific purpose.
            </p>

            <p>
              For example, an agency could train a model using its own agency
              policies, data, regulations, and action with the goal that the
              model would provide more agency-specific outputs.
            </p>

            <p>
              Models can also be “fine tuned,” meaning you can change how the
              model works, adjusting what it should treat as more important or
              less important. You can even change what it outputs to make it
              more relevant, such as following a particular style of writing or
              imagery.
            </p>

            <p>
              And if no existing model seems to come close you can create your
              own model then train it with custom data, fine tune how it works,
              and tailor the outputs to meet your specific needs.
            </p>

            <h2></h2>
            <h2>1.4. Potential Risks of Generative AI</h2>
            <p>
              Generative AI poses a range of potential risks including the ones
              below. This is not an exhaustive list. New risks are being
              discovered continually.
            </p>
            <h3>Misinformation and Disinformation</h3>
            <p>
              Generative AI can create highly realistic but false content, such
              as “deepfakes” – images, audio, video or text which make it look
              like someone said or did something they didn’t. This can be used
              to spread falsehoods that polarize people, destabilize
              communities, and even incite crimes.
            </p>

            <h3>Errors and Inaccuracies</h3>
            <p>
              Generative AI models can produce incorrect or nonsensical outputs,
              often because of limitations in their training data or algorithms.
              These errors can lead to misinformation, incorrect decisions, and
              misinterpretations, which can lead to flawed policy decisions or
              misinformed public statements.
            </p>

            <h3>Bias and Discrimination</h3>
            <p>
              AI systems, if they have been trained on discriminatory or
              one-sided data, can lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes in
              public services.
            </p>

            <h3>Prompt Manipulation</h3>
            <p>
              There is a risk of Generative AI systems providing biased or
              misleading outputs, especially when users deliberately input
              incorrect or slanted information. Malicious actors could exploit
              this to generate harmful content, spread disinformation, or
              extract sensitive data.
            </p>

            <h3>Misalignment with Laws and Policies</h3>
            <p>
              The use of Generative AI must be carefully evaluated to ensure
              compliance with applicable laws, policies and procedures around
              transparency, accountability, and other aspects of ethical use.
            </p>

            <h3>Security and Cybersecurity Threats</h3>
            <p>
              Generative AI can be exploited for cyber-attacks, including
              sophisticated phishing and malware that evades detection, and is
              vulnerable to adversarial attacks aimed at manipulating outputs.
              Insecure AI systems risk data theft and sabotage, undermining
              public trust and national security.
            </p>

            <h3>Privacy Risks</h3>
            <p>
              The volume and type of data involved in the use of Generative AI
              raises concerns about privacy and the use and protection of
              personal information when training these technologies, inputting
              data and outputting content.
            </p>

            <h3>Intellectual Property and Plagiarism</h3>
            <p>
              Generative AI raises complex issues regarding copyright
              infringement and originality. This poses significant challenges
              for determining the ownership and originality of AI-generated
              works.
            </p>
            <h3>Environmental Impact</h3>
            <p>
              Similar to cloud computing, training and operating large AI models
              requires substantial computational resources, leading to
              significant electricity usage. Additionally, the production and
              disposal of the specialized computing hardware (like GPUs and
              CPUs) necessary for AI development involve resource-intensive
              processes and contribute to electronic waste. This environmental
              impact is compounded by the infrastructure needs of data centers,
              including land usage and cooling systems.
            </p>

            <h3>Model Training Delay</h3>
            <p>
              Since there is a time lag between when the model is trained and
              when the model is used there is a risk that the model doesn’t
              reflect current norms, regulations, or realities, which could
              cause the AI tool to generate irrelevant or inappropriate outputs.
            </p>

            <h3>Ownership</h3>
            <p>
              Generative AI tools create data based on the inputs that it has
              been trained on and new data inputted by users. Aside from the
              intellectual property issues mentioned above, there are
              significant concerns over who owns the inputted and outputted
              data. If a user inputs documents for the Generative AI tool to use
              is that data now owned by the company who owns the Generative AI
              tool or does the user still own it? If the Generative AI created
              lines of computer code is that code now owned by the user or the
              company who owns the Generative AI tool? Is the Generative AI tool
              allowed to “learn” from the data it created and use it to create
              code for some other user?
            </p>
            <h2>1.5 Typical Generative AI Tools</h2>

              to create efficiencies for the hazard mitigation planning process
              for local governments, including underserved communities. Hazard
              mitigation plans are not only a foundational step that communities
              can take to build their resilience but can be lengthy to produce
              and challenging for communities that lack resources to do so. The
              pilot will specifically support State, Local, Tribal, and
              Territorial governments’ understanding of how to craft a plan that
              identifies risks and mitigation strategies as well as generate
              draft plan elements—from publicly-available, well-researched
              sources — that governments could customize to meet their needs.
              This pilot could lead to more communities having the ability to
              submit grant applications for funding to become more resilient and
              reduce disaster risks.

              Here are select components of a Generative AI acquisition. These
              are starting points and don’t represent the only practices or
              approaches for acquiring Generative AI. This also is not a strict
              sequence as much as it is a collection of focus areas that should
              be considered as part of any Generative AI acquisition.
            </p>

            <p>
              Additionally, your agency may have specific requirements, policies
              and guidelines that you must follow as part of any Generative AI
              acquisition.

          <h2>3.1. Integrated Product Team</h2>

          <p>
            Generative AI procurement is not just a procurement or IT department
            task. Many agencies have consolidated their AI decision making under
            a Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer (CAIO). Some agencies,
            commissions and departmental components may assign this
            responsibility under their CIO or IT support organization.
          </p>

          <p>
            The CAIO plays a vital role in any Generative AI project. They are
            often the responsible official ensuring that the right policies and
            protections are in place for any AI project in their agency. They
            can be the project sponsor who is trying to get specific Generative
            AI pilots and experiments underway. They are also subject matter
            experts who can provide guidance on which are the right solutions to
            consider and how to best implement Generative AI products in the
            agency’s current technology environments. CAIOs can be strong
            partners for acquisition teams looking to help program staff get a
            Generative AI project off the ground and running smoothly.
          </p>

          <p>
            As a start, your agency’s CAIO and program officials can provide
            insight into the maturity of the agency’s IT and AI capabilities,
            policies, and skills. Your agency may already be using Generative AI
            tools and may be familiar with how to best work with them.
          </p>

          <p>
            Consider creating an Integrated Product Team (IPT) drawing from
            across the agency or sub-agency. Integrated Product Teams are
            successful because each role brings different perspectives and
            knowledge. Given the complex and cross-cutting nature of many
            Generative AI decisions a cross-agency IPT involving agency
            officials with expertise in the specific program, technology, data,
            and other relevant domains (e.g., security, privacy, legal, finance,
            acquisition, etc.) can help work through challenges and identify
            opportunities. Having multiple voices and ideas can make working
            through thorny challenges more effective.
          </p>

          <p>
            Led by a technical program manager, the IPT consists of program
            staff who can voice needs and advocate for the agency’s mission, AI
            practitioners, software engineers, data engineers, security experts,
            privacy officials and acquisition professionals. Finance, legal,
            accessibility and other representatives can be brought in along the
            way.
          </p>

          <p>
            An IPT can set the project objectives and constraints, research and
            vet solutions, and identify potential risks and consequences. The
            team can identify and review agency related AI policies and
            guidance. In the case of Generative AI, the IPT can also serve as
            the means for continued monitoring and evaluation of the capability
            as described in section 3.8.
          </p>

          <p>The IPT can address these types of issues:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Integration and interoperability of solutions with existing
              systems and data
            </li>
            <li>Data rights and ownership</li>
            <li>Data protections</li>
            <li>Responsible use of data and tools</li>
            <li>Intellectual property provisions</li>
            <li>End-user licensing agreements</li>
            <li>Appropriations implications for different types of pricing</li>
            <li>
              Security measures and privacy implications to start a pilot or
              scale a solution
            </li>
            <li>Performance testing, monitoring and control</li>
            <li>Accessibility considerations</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>3.2 Agency Goals and Needs.</h2>

          <p>
            There are many different types of Generative AI products and
            services, each with their own strengths. Don’t jump to a particular
            solution first. Instead, begin by understanding what program staff
            want to do and achieve, then find the right solutions and suppliers
            that will best help them.
          </p>

          <p>
            Program staff and leaders can be a great source for identifying and
            refining problem statements and how they link back to the agency’s
            mission. Technical leaders including the agency Chief Information
            Officer (CIO), Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) and Chief
            Privacy Officer (CPO) offer important perspectives about what
            current systems and tools can do and how they can be used. Many
            agencies have also selected a Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer
            (CAIO) to oversee AI efforts including Generative AI work. CAIOs are
            a vital voice to have at the table when scoping agency goals and
            needs.
          </p>

          <p>Some potential questions to ask include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>What specific problems does the agency want to solve?</li>
            <li>
              What opportunities does Generative AI present that the agency
              wants to pursue?
            </li>
            <li>
              Are other agencies seeking to solve similar problems or use
              Generative AI for similar purposes that you can learn from?
            </li>
            <li>
              What are gaps in current technology tools that Generative AI could
              fill?
            </li>
            <li>What are the desired outcomes of using Generative AI tools?</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Sometimes just by posing these questions an agency can determine
            that it already has non-Generative AI tools (and even non-AI tools)
            that can be deployed quickly or that the problems themselves aren’t
            worth the investment to solve.
          </p>

          <p>
            Many agencies are in a space of needing or wanting to experiment or
            “do something” with Generative AI solutions to understand what the
            technology can do. Technical experimentation is healthy and
            important for agencies. If your agency is just trying to get
            exposure to Generative AI tools and their capabilities, it could be
            helpful to start with smaller problems and perhaps ones that are not
            mission critical, but ones that can’t be easily solved with current
            non-Generative AI tools.
          </p>

            For ideas and inspiration of what problems and projects might be
            good to work on, see sections 1 and 2 of this guide. Agency use

          <h2>3.3 Solutions Scoping and Testing</h2>

          <p>
            It’s often difficult to know which Generative AI tool will be best
            for your agency’s purposes. That’s why it’s always best to spend
            time actually trying them out first. The Integrated Product Team
            (IPT) can see which tools have the right combinations of functions
            and features that work with the data the agency has and help get to
            the goals the agency wants to achieve.
          </p>

          <h3>3.3.1 Categories of Generative AI Solutions</h3>
          <p>
            Knowing the agency’s priority problems to focus on and how
            Generative AI tools might address those needs, the IPT can scout
            potential Generative AI solutions. Perhaps they need tools that can
            analyze and generate initial text to jumpstart reporting. Perhaps
            they need Generative AI-enabled chatbots that can respond to public
            inquiries with specific information that an agency has uploaded in
            the LLM.
          </p>

          <p>
            The IPT can identify potential categories of solutions, which
            functions and features are needed to address the agency’s priority
            problems and initial performance requirements.
          </p>

          <p>
            For a starter list of Generative AI solutions categories, consider
            the typical Generative AI tools shown in section 1.5 of this guide.
          </p>

          <h3>3.3.2 Cloud Platform Sandboxes</h3>
          <p>
            No two Generative AI systems work exactly the same. What a supplier
            says their product can do might be close to what your agency wants
            or needs but may require tweaks to really make them work. At the
            same time, Generative AI systems are also evolving rapidly.
            Functions that don’t exist now might be available later.
            <a
              class="external_link"
              href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/M-24-10-Advancing-Governance-Innovation-and-Risk-Management-for-Agency-Use-of-Artificial-Intelligence.pdf"
              >OMB Management Memo M-24-10</a
            >
            provides a helpful reference about what sort of AI-enabling
            infrastructure and/or testing might best inform this process.
          </p>

          <p>
            Testing solutions before actually doing a full-scale purchase can
            help ensure the Generative AI products meet your specific agency’s
            needs. The IPT can then translate their experiences testing
            solutions into requirements and use cases for an acquisition plan
            and contract documents that will meet their goals.
          </p>

          <p>
            “Sandboxes” are test beds that agencies can use to experiment with
            Generative AI tools. Think of them as low scale versions of tech you
            are exploring. These sandboxes allow users to try different tools
            and identify which ones work best for your agency’s needs. They can
            also help more accurately estimate the amount of effort and cost it
            might take to complete the project.
          </p>

          <p>
            A subset of the IPT can bring their expertise in data, workflows and
            security to scope the sandbox and begin running tests with data and
            different Generative AI tools, subject to legal and policy
            restrictions and with appropriate safeguards.
          </p>

          <p>
            In many cases, the IPT can create a sandbox on a cloud platform that
            allows them to upload their data and try different Generative AI
            modules to see what kinds of results each gives. Because most
            Generative AI tools are available through cloud platforms this is an
            easy and relatively quick way to get started.
          </p>

          <p>
            Consider what data would be appropriate to use in a testing
            environment and what restrictions may apply to certain kinds of data
            (e.g., personally identifiable information, confidential business
            information, etc.). Until you have verified a system’s privacy and
            data security capabilities through an ATO process or FedRAMP
            certification, consider using only publicly available data in
            sandboxes.
          </p>

          <h4>Multiple Sandboxes</h4>
          <p>
            Some IPTs may even decide to set up multiple sandboxes on a few
            different cloud platforms so they can test both which modules work
            best for the agency’s needs and which platforms offer the most
            flexibility, lowest cost and best return on investment. Because each
            cloud platform and module works differently, be cautious and conduct
            individual security and privacy reviews for each sandbox before
            putting data into each sandbox.
          </p>

          <h4>Setting Up Sandboxes</h4>
          <p>
            Typically setting up and using these sandboxes can happen under the
            Simplified Acquisition Threshold (SAT) since they are used for small
            scale experiments. The IPT can create sandboxes using current
            contracts with a Value Added Reseller (VAR). The IPT may have to go
            through extra steps to access third party products through your
            sandbox. You may need to update or include new terms and conditions
            with the vendor. Consider creating a concept of operations (CONOPS)
            or charter with your agency’s CIO, CAIO and CISO organizations to
            operate these. Sandboxes that do not use government data and are not
            connected to the agency network allow for flexibility to experiment
            with new software quickly.
          </p>

          <h4>Performance Metrics and Evaluation</h4>
          <p>
            To get the most useful feedback about the Generative AI tool, test
            their performance in conditions that mirror how the tool will be
            deployed in the real world. The IPT can create metrics and
            evaluation criteria for testing and assessing the performance of
            solutions at any dollar threshold. If the tool will be used by the
            public or non-technical staff, the IPT may want to also conduct
            basic user experience, usability and accessibility testing of the
            tool across a range of devices (desktops, laptops, tablets and
            smartphones).
          </p>

          <h3>3.3.3 Non-Cloud Platform Sandboxes</h3>
          <p>
            Some tools may not be available through a traditional cloud
            platform. Working with the Generative AI tool vendor to use a trial
            version or create a custom sandbox for your agency might be needed.
            As with other testbeds, always make sure to check with your agency’s
            CIO, CISO, CAIO and OGC to ensure that the tools comply with all
            relevant security and privacy laws and policies.
          </p>

          <p>
            The IPT may opt to test “self-hosted” tools that sit on the
            agencies’ own IT infrastructure and use “open source” models that
            are widely available rather than closed, proprietary systems. These
            options can offer greater control over the Generative AI tools and
            may save costs paid to external providers but may require more
            internal resources to manage.
          </p>

          <h3>3.3.4 Specifying Generative AI Solutions.</h3>
          <p>
            With some sense of what combinations of platform and Generative AI
            tools work for the data the agency has and the outcomes it wants,
            the IPT can determine what the agency will need to acquire.
          </p>

          <p>
            The agency may require access to a new cloud platform or to change
            the terms of use for an existing platform. The IPT may decide it
            needs to have access to several different Generative AI tools. The
            experiments they ran in the sandbox may show the need for several
            accounts and more “credits” to scale up operations. Engineers may
            decide that they want to be able to integrate Generative AI
            functions into their own systems and need access to APIs.
          </p>

          <p>
            Determine the products and services that the IPT needs to succeed,
            the quantities, the performance requirements and any other
            specifications needed to write a clear statement about what the
            agency is interested in purchasing. If the IPT needs a specific
            supplier’s products, start to assemble the information for a
            brand-name justification
          </p>

          <h3>3.3.5 Advanced Generative AI Options</h3>
          <p>
            Sandbox tests and other considerations may show that the IPT
            requires more sophisticated Generative AI capabilities. They may
            want to:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <h4>Fine-tune a Pre-Trained Model</h4>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            LLMs rely on algorithms where different connections and information
            are given more or less “weight” or significance. Fine tuning is a
            process of changing those weights so different information is
            treated as more or less important.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <h4>Customize a Pre-Trained Model</h4>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            LLMs are trained on a certain set of initial data. The LLM can be
            customized further with more up-to-date information or information
            relevant to a specific field which makes it significantly more
            useful or even links to searchable databases.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <h4>Train and Fine-Tune a Model</h4>
            </li>

            A team may decide that they want to take the basic architecture and
            algorithms of an LLM and train it on completely different data and
            weight the information in a very specific way. This can give a
            specialized result meant for a particular purpose.

          </ul>
          <p>
            A team may want to develop everything themselves from the ground up,
            crafting their own algorithms, determining their own weights of what
            information is more important and training it with its own data.
            This is a significant lift but may be necessary for very specific
            uses such as high-security applications.

          <p>
            Typically these kinds of projects require greater effort, expertise,
            data security monitoring and oversight so IPTs should think deeply
            about the investment and whether the agency truly requires it.

          <h2>3.4 Data Management and Protection</h2>

          <p>
            Data is at the heart of all Generative AI tools. The foundation
            models are trained on billions to trillions of pieces of data. Users
            can put new data in and the models will learn from that data. And
            Generative AI tools produce text, images and a whole host of other
            data. Properly protecting and managing that data as required by
            applicable law and policy is a critical consideration for any
            Generative AI acquisition.
          </p>

          <p>
            It’s critical to know what data was used to build and train the
            system initially and how the training data relates to the data you
            will use the Generative AI tool on, including potential implications
            for bias. It’s equally more important to know whether the data you
            input will be used to train and improve the system or whether it
            will be deleted after the query is complete. You’ll need to know how
            the data you input might be outputted to other users when responding
            to their prompts. And you will also want to understand how you can
            transfer to or use your data in other systems. The IPT can then
            identify, document and monitor where there are unknowns around the
            data outputs, usage and ownership.
          </p>

            has requirements for what data to review and issues to investigate.
          </p>

          <h3>3.4.1 Data Security</h3>
          <p>
            Using data responsibly and protecting data from unauthorized access
            are high priorities for data from both inside or outside of the
            government. Consult with your Agency’s Privacy Officer, CIO and
            Security Officer to assess data management requirements and risks.
            At the most basic level, data must be securely stored and securely
            transmitted. Secure networks prevent data from being compromised in
            transit.
          </p>

          <p>
            Protections prevent unauthorized access. If there is any chance
            information considered non-public by your agency officials would be
            used in a Generative AI tool, then those tools can only run on
            systems that have the right protections and safeguards in place. But
            even with publicly available information or information available
            for unlimited distribution, ensure that Federal data protection
            standards and regulations will be met. And because cyber threats are
            only getting worse, Generative AI systems must have proper
            cybersecurity systems including threat detection and risk
            mitigation.
          </p>

          <h3>3.4.2 Data Inventory</h3>
          <p>
            List the data that will be involved in the Generative AI tools the
            agency plans to use. Major types of data to manage include but isn’t
            limited to:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Generative AI Training, Testing and Validation Data - This is the
              information that the manufacturer of the Generative AI tool used
              to create the LLM and see if it worked well.
            </li>

            <li>
              Generative AI Fine-Tuning Data - This is the information that
              either the manufacturer of the Generative AI tool or the users of
              the tool (including your agency) use to customize the LLM to
              better serve specific purposes.
            </li>

            <li>
              Agency Inputted Data - This is the information that the agency
              staff feeds into the model so the LLM can summarize it, find
              patterns and insights or transform it and the prompts that
              agencies put in to get answers from the LLM.
            </li>

            <li>
              Generative AI Outputted Data - This is the information that the
              LLM creates based on the training, testing and agency inputted
              data.
            </li>

            <li>
              Gen AI Code and Models - This is the set of algorithms and
              programming that make up the model itself.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>3.4.3 Understanding How Data is Used</h3>
          <p>
            Understanding and identifying training and testing data, input data
            and output data are critical to managing a successful Generative AI
            project or program. Both users and owners of the tool and data have
            equities in how they are managed and used.
          </p>

          <p>
            Here are initial questions to help the IPT get a better sense of the
            data associated with the agency’s use of Generative AI, how to
            appropriately assess and mitigate risks, and how to ensure
            government data rights are protected. This list of questions is not
            exhaustive, nor will all the questions be applicable in every
            situation.

          <p>
            Generative AI’s need for training data raises questions and privacy
            concerns about where, when and how that data was collected. Model
            cards and similar resources can help explain the origin and nature
            of the training data and quantify the risk of bias, discrimination
            or similar harm to people.
          </p>

          <p>
            Generative AI applications are built on training data. Understanding
            the data, its biases and its current applications and usage will
            help to identify whether a particular application or model is more
            appropriate to meet needs.
          </p>

          <p>
            The CAIO of the agency is responsible for ensuring that Generative
            AI systems comply with relevant standards as detailed in
            <a
              class="external_link"
              href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/M-24-10-Advancing-Governance-Innovation-and-Risk-Management-for-Agency-Use-of-Artificial-Intelligence.pdf"

            >. Acquisition staff can assist by documenting their process and
            decisions.
          </p>

          <p>
            Asking suppliers to share information about their products helps
            acquisition staff know that there is transparency and accountability
            in the procurement. At the same time, it helps the IPT and CAIO
            jointly monitor compliance later.

            This guide lists some but not all of the potential risks of
            Generative AI in Section 1 including Misinformation and
            Disinformation, Privacy, Bias and Discrimination and
            Security/Cybersecurity. Clarifying ethical challenges related to
            data and completing a risk assessment are potential ways to identify
            risks for data and determine how to monitor and mitigate them.

            With the IPT having defined the agency’s goals, tested Generative AI
            solutions in sandboxes, developed requirements and defined how data
            will be managed, you can map out what you intend to buy and how you
            intend to buy it. You can specify the performance metrics of the
            Generative AI products, tools, functions, modules or add-ons that
            will best serve the agency based on the sandbox tests the IPT
            completed. There are multiple ways to answer the question of “how to
            buy it.”
          </p>

          <h3>3.5.1 The fastest acquisition may be no new acquisition.</h3>
          <p>
            Generative AI tools are often software delivered via the web or
            “Software as a Service” (SaaS). So like other SaaS tools most
            Generative AI tools are easily available through cloud platforms,
            other software packages and publicly-available websites.
          </p>

          <p>
            Generative AI tools may already be available to agency staff. They
            might have them in tools they already use every day. Generative AI
            tools may be accessible through existing government cloud platforms.
            And they may be available through professional service and system
            integrator contracts agencies already have in place.
          </p>

          <p>
            That means your agency might be able to access Generative AI
            solutions without doing a new acquisition.
          </p>

          <p>
            In that way, the fastest acquisition for Generative AI tools may be
            no new acquisition, or as simple as adding “credits” to an existing
            cloud platform contract to account for the new requirements or
            resources associated with the Generative AI tools.
          </p>

          <p>
            Of course the fastest or easiest solutions may not be the best for
            the agency in the short and/or long term. Work with the IPT to
            manage issues of competition and vendor lock in.
          </p>

          <p>
            Before embarking on a large scale or involved process for scoping
            and conducting a new acquisition for Generative AI tools, see if
            there is a simpler route. Work with your agency’s Chief Information
            Officer, Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer and Chief Information
            Security Officer to determine what you already have in place and
            whether you can just use an existing solution or contract.
          </p>

          <p>Here are a few options:</p>

          <h4>From public web tools you can access</h4>
          <p>
            Many providers offer basic Generative AI tools and services from a
            freely available public page or a search page. If your agency
            staff’s Generative AI needs are basic, consider using one of these
            basic, free tools. This might only be acceptable in very few use
            cases. Also note that use of free public tools will likely limit the
            data you can use and the amount of information available to address
            some of the risks and concerns identified in previous sections, so
            carefully consider these limitations before use. Review the terms of
            service with your agency’s legal team before using these tools to
            ensure compliance.
          </p>

          <h4>In software you have</h4>
          <p>
            Lots of software packages have basic Generative AI functionality
            built in. Before you start a new acquisition, check with your
            agency’s IT group. You may already have access to the right
            Generative AI tools within your existing software.
          </p>

          <h4>Via a cloud platform you use</h4>
          <p>
            Many cloud platforms and “hyperscalers” provide access to Generative
            AI tools as modules from right within their platforms. Agency staff
            might be able to use their current cloud platform accounts and
            credits to pay for and use those modules if it is within the scope
            of the underlying, pre-existing contract.
          </p>

            Best Practices when Accessing Generative AI Tools via a Cloud
            Platform
          </h5>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Get formal risk management approval from the OCIO, CISO, CAIO and
              OGC. The EO stipulates AI use cases need to be risk managed by
              contract authorities or agency IT. If there is not yet a
              formalized process, document your approvals from the relevant
              agency officials.
            </li>
            <li>
              Consider creating a concept of operations (CONOPS) or charter with
              your agency’s CIO, CAIO and CISO organizations to operate these.
            </li>
            <li>
              Identify which cloud platforms your agency has access to, which
              office(s) own the contracts and what the terms and conditions are.
              In many cases, the contract and contracting officer are assigned
              to the CIO organization.
            </li>
            <li>
              Prioritize security even for experiments. Choose cloud platforms
              and modules that have received FedRAMP authorizations. Understand
              how your data may be used to train the model or improve outputs,
              with and without your consent.
            </li>
            <li>
              Develop a cost estimate based on the pricing in the contract. If
              the contract is with a Value Added Reseller, there may be
              management costs for the vendor in addition to the credits needed
              to stand up the environment.
            </li>
            <li>
              Ensure you are getting access to the right version of the
              platforms. Many cloud platforms have different versions for
              commercial and government each with special security options and
              pricing models. You may also need to request permission to access
              Generative AI modules if there are only test versions available
              for federal environments.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>
            From a professional services provider or IT system integrator on
            contract
          </h4>
          <p>
            A growing number of consultants are offering Generative AI access
            through their existing professional services contracts. IT system
            integrators have also built Generative AI tools and interfaces to
            others’ tools. Agency staff can sometimes access such tools through
            a custom portal or from software that the consultant or SIs have
            deployed. Depending on their contract and task order, a consultant
            or SI might already be able to provide or build a custom solution to
            provide access to Generative AI tools.
          </p>

          <p>
            With any of the above options, keep in mind that even though you
            might not do a new acquisition you may still need to modify the
            terms and conditions of an existing contract, obligate funds to buy
            more credits or upgrade subscriptions or exercise an option.
          </p>

          <p>
            And of course, especially for what looks to be “free,” check with
            your agency’s Chief Information Officer, Chief Artificial
            Intelligence Officer and Chief Information Security Officer to
            ensure the tools meet all appropriate regulations, standards and
            policies.
          </p>

          <h3>3.5.2 Acquisition Channels for Generative AI</h3>
          <p>
            If you need to do an acquisition to access Generative AI tools a few
            options exist. The acquisition method or vehicle you choose may
            influence which of these options is most appropriate. As with any
            acquisition, existing providers should be a consideration and not a
            requirement that impedes competition
          </p>

          <h4>
            Acquire access to Generative AI tools or functions within software
            you already have.
          </h4>
          <p>
            Typically the acquisition process for getting these Generative AI
            features will look like paying more for a higher subscription or to
            move up to the next feature tier that has the more expensive
            functions. If you procure that software through a Value Added
            Reseller (VAR) there may be a management fee in addition to the cost
            of Generative AI tools access.
          </p>

          <p>
            Note that many software providers are adding Generative AI
            capabilities into existing software. Ensuring you review any changes
            to the functionality or the terms and conditions will help you to
            identify whether these capabilities are present in new software
            updates and deliveries.
          </p>

          <h4>
            Acquire access to Generative AI tools directly from the
            manufacturer.
          </h4>
          <p>
            The acquisition process will probably look like paying the
            manufacturer according to their pricing structures. The manufacturer
            may use a Value Added Reseller (VAR) who may charge a management fee
            in addition to the cost of Generative AI tools access.
          </p>
          <h4>
            Acquire access to a cloud platform and Generative AI tools through
            that platform.
          </h4>
          <p>
            The acquisition process should involve procuring access to the cloud
            platform and then paying for using the Generative AI tools. Many of
            the cloud platforms use resellers who may charge a management fee in
            addition to the cost of Generative AI tools access.
          </p>
          <h4>
            Acquire access to Generative AI tools through a system integrator.
          </h4>
          <p>
            System integrators all have different pricing models but you can
            expect to find many that bill as professional services by the hour,
            week or month. They may charge separately for Generative AI tools
            access.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many Generative AI tool manufacturers use multiple channels for
            their products. They sell their tools directly, they use resellers
            and they make their tools available through cloud platforms and
            system integrators. Often the prices vary among the channels – in
            some cases you have to pay if you go to the manufacturer but you can
            get limited uses of products for free through partners.
          </p>

          <p>
            Look carefully at the different acquisition options and determine
            what best meets your agency’s needs. Identify which options offer…
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              The trackable, transparent and cost-effective pricing models
            </li>
            <li>
              The flexibility and scalability for changing users, usage or use
              cases
            </li>
            <li>
              The terms and conditions for proper security and data management
            </li>
            <li>The ease for agency staff to access and use the tool</li>
            <li>
              The speed of acquiring access once the solicitation is released
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Custom Solutions</h4>
          <p>
            In certain cases, the IPT may decide it needs more than just access
            to Generative AI tools and actually needs a custom solution that is
            tailored or built specifically for their use. Such acquisitions may
            end up looking like other purpose-built software purchases in
            pricing, terms and conditions and process.
          </p>

          <h3>3.5.3 Acquisition Vehicle Selection</h3>
          <p>
            You can choose from many options of acquisition vehicles, including
            governmentwide acquisition contracts. This guide includes a list of
            potential acquisition vehicles available for civilian agencies. Some
            vehicles will be a better fit for your agency’s particular needs. A
            few questions to ask as you evaluate which acquisition vehicle might
            be best to use for your needs:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Does your agency have an anticipated contract type?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Your agency may prefer or need to use a certain type of contract.
            There are multiple contract types outlined in
            <a
              class="external_link"
              href="https://www.acquisition.gov/far/part-16"
              >FAR Part 16</a
            >
            such as fixed price, cost reimbursement and time and materials. Not
            every acquisition vehicle can accommodate all contract types. It is
            important to research whether the anticipated contract type aligns
            with a specific vehicle.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Is the acquisition vehicle designated Best-in-Class?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Your agency may benefit from using acquisition vehicles that have
            been designated Best-in-Class (BIC) by the Office of Management and
            Budget (OMB). BIC vehicles maximize the government’s shared
            purchasing power, allowing agencies to leverage volume discounts;
            help agencies operate more efficiently by reducing administrative
            costs and contract duplication; and expand sharing of
            government-wide buying data, leading to better-informed decisions.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Does your agency have specific socio-economic requirements or
              targets?
              <br />
              Your agency may plan to set-aside a contract requirement to target
              certain socioeconomic categories such as Veteran-Owned Small
              Businesses (VOSBs) or those in the 8(a) Business Development
              program. Some vehicles provide easy ways to access such suppliers.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Does your agency have budget/resource constraints?
              <br />
              Your agency may need to keep to a strict dollar limit for a
              purchase. Some vehicles have negotiated better prices or fees in
              exchange for the buying agency taking on more of the burden of the
              acquisition from reporting to compliance checks.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
            <li>Does your agency have preferred or approved vehicles?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Your agency may have identified particular contracts as part of its
            strategic sourcing efforts that it prefers to use. Some vehicles may
            be designated as preferred or even mandatory vehicles because they
            meet your agency priorities and not using these vehicles would
            require a waiver.
            <br />
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Does your agency have its own capacity to verify compliance?
              <br />
              Your agency may prefer to not worry about reviewing or verifying
              whether suppliers are in compliance with relevant policies and
              regulations. Some vehicles have pre-negotiated terms and
              conditions that ensure suppliers comply with such rules.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Are the products or services you need available on the vehicle you
              plan to select?
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Your agency may have very specific requirements for the solutions
            they are trying to procure. Some vehicles may have the right
            suppliers or products available while others do not.
          </p>

            The marketplace for Generative AI technologies and vendors is
            changing every day. Large Generative AI companies, universities,
            small businesses and new upstarts are all announcing new tools,
            capabilities and features constantly. Generative AI is such a
            popular topic that there are multiple articles on these advancements

          <h3>3.6.2. FedRAMP Authorization</h3>
          <p>
            As many Generative AI products are cloud based offerings complying
            with Federal security rules around cloud services is essential.
          </p>

          <p>
            Products which have gone through the FedRAMP process have undergone
            a significant review of security documentation, testing and
            validation which can accelerate CIO approval for a product to be
            incorporated into an agency network. The
            <a
              class="external_link"
              href="https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/products"
              >FedRAMP Marketplace</a
            >
            is a searchable and sortable database of cloud service offerings
            that have achieved a FedRAMP designation
          </p>

          <p>
            FedRAMP also published a draft
            <a
              class="external_link"
              href="https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/FedRAMP_DRAFT_Emerging_Technology_Prioritization_Framework.pdf"

            will prioritize certain cloud service offerings that utilize
            specific emerging technologies.
          </p>

          <p>
            The prioritization process will be integrated into existing and
            future FedRAMP authorization paths. The prioritization framework
            will not create additional authorization pathways and will maintain
            the same rigorous and thorough authorization requirements.

          <h3>3.6.3 Vendor Diligence</h3>
          <p>
            Acquisition professionals are used to conducting due diligence on
            suppliers. Generative AI is an emerging field with new players
            arising all the time. Knowing which vendors can deliver on their
            promised results is difficult and a big reason to test solutions
            before acquiring them using techniques like sandboxes discussed in
            Section 3.3.
          </p>
          <p>
            Standard due diligence on companies is still important. Looking at
            their track record as a government supplier, their financial health
            and their past performance are all good indications (but not
            guarantees) of how they might perform on an acquisition you run.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the same time, because this field is emerging, some companies
            doing sophisticated and powerful work have been in business for less
            than 10 years. Aside from the older, larger and established IT
            players, many of the Generative AI companies aren’t registered
            government suppliers yet.
          </p>

          <p>
            Because many Generative AI solutions may be accessed through a cloud
            provider, a partner, a systems integrator or a reseller, you may
            need to do some extra work to understand both the vendor’s and
            manufacturer’s ability to deliver. Ask about what access the team
            may have to the Generative AI tool manufacturer even through the
            contract may be with another entity.
          </p>

          <p>
            Reviewing the commercial terms and conditions for software and data
            use helps ensure data use and the products themselves meet the
            government requirements for security and data ownership.
          </p>

          <h2>3.7 Cost Estimation</h2>

          <p>
            Given the large amount of IT budget that often has to go towards
            ongoing operation and maintenance, costs can be a significant
            impediment to Generative AI acquisition.
          </p>

          <p>
            Generative AI systems are software systems. Suppliers bill for them
            mostly like other “Software as a Service” (SaaS) tools with some
            slight variants. You may need to pay for both monthly access to the
            Generative AI system plus how much time you use it plus how much
            data you input or output.
          </p>

          <h4>
            Costs for using Generative AI tools can add up quickly and
            unpredictably.
          </h4>
          <p>
            Setting up systems to accurately forecast and check actual costs
            against the budget when using Generative AI tools helps address
            concerns about growing consumption costs.
          </p>

          <p>
            Understand your agency’s users, use cases, desired outcomes and
            internal policies to help develop accurate estimates.
          </p>

          <p>
            Having an understanding of fiscal law principles associated with
            purchasing SaaS and Cloud will help you to appropriately structure
            and manage your Generative AI project.
          </p>

          <h3>3.7.1 Generative AI tools are sold like software.</h3>
          <p>
            Again, most commercial Generative AI tools are considered “software”
            so they tend to be sold the way most software is sold and priced
            nowadays. Agencies pay fees for software in three main ways:
            subscriptions, usage and feature tiers.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <h4>Subscriptions</h4>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Agency pays per month or year for each account that renews at the
            end of the term until canceled, regardless of how much you use the
            model. Think of this like the fee you might pay for a video
            streaming service: you can watch as much as you want for a flat fee
            per month or per year.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <h4>Usage</h4>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Agency identifies and obligates funding for requirements, which is
            in turn billed for the amount of data inputted or outputted, the
            time or resources used on a particular platform or the quality of
            output. Think of this like the fee you might pay for a rideshare:
            you pay for the length of the trip, the time the trip takes and a
            little more if a lot of people are trying to get rides at the same
            time.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <h4>Feature Tiers</h4>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Agency pays once per the group of functions and features regardless
            of consumption/usage or number of users. Think of this like the
            one-time fee you might pay for a membership: you pay one fee to the
            club which entitles you to lifetime benefits and if you pay a higher
            fee you get more benefits like access to exclusive sales.
          </p>

          <p>
            Generative AI tools typically charge some combination of these fees.
            Here are a few examples based on real life cases:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              A reseller charges an agency $20 per month per user for email,
              word processing, spreadsheets and presentations programs and apps.
              They charge an additional $20 per month for Generative AI features
              and functions in these same programs and apps.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
            <li>
              A company offers the ability to “train” an AI model charges an
              agency a base rate per month for an account plus a $10 per million
              credits or tokens where each token represents an individual word
              of “training data” that the agency uploads.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
            <li>
              A cloud platform provider charges a certain amount to get access
              to a Generative AI model but then charges the agency for every
              minute they use the model or for every time they access a database
              that the model connects to.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>3.7.2 Estimating the Costs of Generative AI Solutions</h3>
          <p>
            To estimate the costs of Generative AI solutions, start by
            understanding the fees that the supplier would charge then ask
            questions to quantify accounts, users, time and usage.

          <h3>3.7.3 Developing estimates for using Generative AI tools</h3>
          <p>
            Subscription pricing generally is straightforward: estimate the
            number of users and the costs. As Generative AI tools are new and
            companies are still figuring out their own costs and revenues these
            rates may change, these costs may change. Though you should always
            try to negotiate for discounts from listed prices, companies are
            rarely offering reduced prices for tools at this time so listed
            prices are realistic for estimating purposes.
          </p>

          <p>
            When accessing generative AI tools through a usage based model,
            account for any type of access costs in addition to actual usage.
            For example, if you are accessing a generative AI tool through your
            Cloud provider’s architecture and you use a Value Added Reseller
            (VAR) for that architecture, your estimate will need to include any
            costs the VAR charges in addition to your usage costs. It is also
            important to understand and account for any additional access
            charges your Cloud provider may add on top of their usage costs and
            the usage costs for the particular generative AI tool.
          </p>

          <p>
            Similar to subscription pricing, estimating costs for software
            feature tiers is generally straightforward but offerings within
            tiers and pricing may change more frequently as companies develop
            and integrate generative AI models and capabilities into their
            products.
          </p>

          <p>
            Four of the largest Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) provide cost
            calculators to assist in estimating a budget and developing a cost
            estimate. Other CSPs may provide similar tools and serve as a basis
            for your estimate. Successfully using these tools requires the
            estimator to have knowledge of the potential workload and types,
            processing speeds and memory needed as well as the number of users.
            Consult with technical experts in your organization and use more
            than one of the tools when building your estimate and ensure you
            coordinate with your legal team on how to appropriately obligate
            funding.
          </p>

          <p>
            Setting up an agency “test bed” or “sandbox” for a particular
            Generative AI model and constructing an experiment is one way to
            understand and start to estimate potential usage costs.
          </p>

          <p>
            When constructing technical architectures the IPT will have
            visibility and options on which components it chooses to use and the
            associated costs with each particular component. Ensuring CORs and
            end users communicate often during the development process and
            operations of the tools will help manage your spend.
          </p>

            Agencies may find they need to contract for specific services to
            develop, tune and maintain their models. Contracting officers should
            reach out to their CAIO’s office to identify the most relevant labor
            categories or skill sets for the particular requirements if this is
            needed. Use tools such as GSA’s
            <a class="external_link" href="https://buy.gsa.gov/pricing/"
              >CALC</a
            >
            to help develop estimates if you have an understanding of
            appropriate labor categories and skill levels.

          <h2>3.8 Performance Monitoring and Evaluation</h2>

          <p>
            Generative AI tools are constantly learning and changing. Once a
            tool is implemented, the IPT must closely monitor how it is used and
            the outputs. Consider provisions in contracts requiring vendors to
            submit deliverables that help monitor and control for risks in using
            the tools.
          </p>

          <h3>3.8.1 Maintaining the IPT</h3>
          <p>
            Continuing the Generative AI IPT for the full lifecycle of using the
            tool brings multiple benefits.
          </p>

          <h4>Training</h4>
          <p>
            The IPT can develop or collect and make available appropriate
            training materials and deliver them to the end users. Part of this
            training should identify the changing nature of generative AI tools
            to help identify if the product is not functioning correctly.
          </p>

          <h4>Incident Detection and Response</h4>
          <p>
            Build in reporting and redress procedures for when something goes
            wrong working in collaboration with your agency’s teams that address
            IT risks. This is particularly important when Generative AI tools
            and their outputs may be used in a manner impacting benefits, rights
            or norms. Robust bias detection and mitigation strategies help to
            stay ahead of problems. Audit and oversight mechanisms can flag when
            incidents occur and when model performance is degrading. All of
            these will help identify when models may need to be refreshed,
            modified, or taken out of production.
          </p>

          <h4>Strategic Objectives</h4>
          <p>
            Regularly reviewing and adjusting Generative AI strategies helps
            ensure they remain effective and aligned with your agency’s goals.
          </p>

          <h3>3.8.2 Engage regularly with vendors</h3>
          <p>
            The inputs and outputs of Generative AI tools may change the
            functionality and performance of the product. Successfully managing
            a Generative AI acquisition requires frequent communication with
            vendors.
          </p>

          <h4>Meeting Performance and Ethical Standards</h4>
          <p>
            Before contract award (even at the solicitation stage and/or built
            into evaluation criteria), meeting with vendors can offer the chance
            to clearly define how they will meet performance and ethical
            standards and mitigate risks associated with the tool. Clarify the
            roles and responsibilities of vendors, particularly if a use case
            has an impact on citizen rights, entitlements or other benefit
            programs.
          </p>

          <h4>Resolving Disputes</h4>
          <p>
            Agree on areas of uncertainty that exist with the generative AI tool
            and how to navigate issues or disputes between the government and
            the vendor providing the model. Document these agreements and
            identify a cadence to review and update them ensuring your legal
            support is included in the process.
          </p>

          <h4>Updating Products</h4>
          <p>
            Identify procedures to measure and support trust and assurance for
            products. This should include testing and system update cycles and
            identifying new capabilities incorporated into the products. Also
            regularly review any changes in commercial terms and conditions
            around data and data usage. Consider doing this through a Service
            Level Agreement (SLA) or other mechanism which the IPT can use to
            monitor vendor performance.
          </p>

          <h4>Protecting Legal Rights</h4>
          <p>
            Where systems may support decisions on rights-impacting programs
            make sure the models can be contested in accordance with the laws,
            statutes and regulations governing the program.
          </p>

          <h4>Controlling Expenses and Costs</h4>
          <p>
            Monitor costs against the cost estimates you created during the
            acquisition. Make sure invoices contain sufficient detail to monitor
            and control expenditures, particularly usage or consumption costs.
            Regularly communicate with end users and the technical team, and
            review invoices to make sure they are in alignment with how the
            Generative AI tools are being used.

            organizes information into a hierarchical structure, comprising
            Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 Categories. This arrangement allows
            for a progressively granular analysis of the government's purchasing
            activities. For example, within the realm of "Information and
            Communication Technology," which could be considered a broader Level
            2 Category, a specific Level 3 Category might be "Application”. This
            specific product categorization helps identify the most relevant
            contract vehicles for the type of product or service an agency is
            looking to procure. By leveraging Level 3 Categories, stakeholders
