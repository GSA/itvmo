              Mr. Warren J. Blankenship serves as the Deputy IT Government-wide Category Manager overseeing day-to-day operations for the Federal IT Governmentwide Category. As such, he manages a portfolio of 13 Best-In-Class (BIC) contract solutions with annual revenue of over $72B, category strategy and annual initiatives outlined in an annual plan to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), agency category support, vehicle data and compliance, and tracking and growing our small business participation across the category.  Through these solutions, he has spearheaded several cross-vehicle initiatives to improve compliance with Cyber and Sustainability buying requirements, award and use of small businesses, and further introduction of emerging solutions to modernize government-wide IT.

            Before this, he held several leadership roles at GSA, including Deputy Director of Contract Operations (FAS/MAS IT), Deputy Director of the Program Office (FAS/MAS IT), Director of the Office of Scientific and Equipment Division (FAS), and Senior Procurement Analyst, where he played a crucial role in formulating and executing Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) rules for GSA's Office of Government-wide Policy (OGP) and the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP). This gave him the unique experience and expertise in procurement and policy to take on the Deputy IT Government-wide Category Manager role. Today, he leads various projects, including monitoring key performance indicators like spend under management, cost avoidance, and small business utilization.
          </p>
