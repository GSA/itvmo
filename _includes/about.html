             Our History
          </h3>
          <p class="tab-p">
            In Fiscal Year (FY) 2020, the Chief Acquisition Officers, Chief Information Officers, and Chief Information Security Officers Councils collectively stressed that more focus was needed on IT vendor relationship management to standardize technical requirements, mitigate cyber-risk, improve data quality, and further leverage the government’s buying power to drive governmentwide improvements and business transformation.
          </p>
          <p class="tab-p">
            In October 2020 (FY2021), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) established the <b>Information Technology Vendor Management Office (ITVMO)</b> within the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.acquisition.gov/content/category-management">Governmentwide Category Management Framework</a> to help solve the challenges agencies face when they buy commodity IT. The lack of a unified, governmentwide IT acquisitions approach means agencies experience different prices for the same products and services, redundant acquisition efforts, and different terms and conditions.
          </p>
          <p class="tab-p">
            The ITVMO advances the goals of <b>Category Management (CM)</b> to improve how the government buys common IT goods and services, including ensuring best pricing and eliminating duplicative contracts. As a collaborative effort between OMB and the largest Federal Acquisitions Programs, including <b>General Services Administration (GSA)</b>, the <b>National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)</b>, the <b>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</b>, and the <b>Department of Defense (DOD)</b>, the ITVMO improves how the government uses acquisition intelligence to inform faster, smarter IT buying.

Before this, I held several leadership roles at GSA, including Deputy Director of Contract Operations (FAS/MAS IT), Deputy Director of the Program Office (FAS/MAS IT), Director of the Office of Scientific and Equipment Division (FAS), and Senior Procurement Analyst, where I played a crucial role in formulating and executing Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) rules for GSA's Office of Government-wide Policy (OGP) and the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP). This gave me the unique experience and expertise in procurement and policy to take on the Deputy IT Government-wide Category Manager role. Today, I lead various projects, including monitoring key performance indicators like spend under management, cost avoidance, and small business utilization. Additionally, I oversee the 13 IT Best-In-Class contract solutions. Through these solutions, I have spearheaded several cross-vehicle initiatives to improve compliance with Cyber and Sustainability buying requirements, award and use of small businesses, and further introduction of emerging solutions to modernize government-wide IT.
                            </p>

                                I earned my Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of the District of Columbia (UDC) and a Master of Arts in Public Communication from the American University. In 2023, I was honored with the FED 100 Award and completed OPM's Executive Leadership Program, Leadership for a Democratic Society. Outside of work, I'm a devoted fan of the Washington Commanders and Nationals, enjoy comedy sitcoms and movies, and consider myself a music connoisseur and enthusiast.

                                Hi, I’m Brittany Chapman, a 14 year Combat Army Veteran. I served honorably as a Combat Medic and Combat Medical logistician supporting Operation Enduring Freedom Afghanistan and Operation Iraqi Freedom. As an IT Best In Class Manager, I provide advice and guidance around Best In Class (BIC) criteria, data standards, and cost avoidance concepts and methodology. This often involves translating overarching policy and guidance from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Category Management Program Management Office (CM PMO) to facilitate the BIC designation process and continuity of existing BIC vehicle solutions to meet designation requirements and analyzing data to create reports the drive recommendations to support enterprise strategic business decisions.

                                Greetings, I'm Peng, and I've been dedicated to federal service for 14 years. Currently, I counsel the ITVMO and IT Government-wide Category, overseeing over $72 billion in obligations. This category encompasses 13 Best in Class IT Acquisition contract solutions operated by NASA, DoD, GSA, and HHS' NIH. I'm privileged to be part of an exceptional team that devises and executes interagency initiatives to advance the utilization of the federal government's premier IT solutions and bolster American small businesses.
                            </p>
                            <p class="padding-top-3">
                                My forte lies in program and category management and process enhancement. A significant ongoing endeavor revolves around formulating the IT Government-wide Category's strategic plan for FY24. Through that, I oversee a team of domain experts in data and IT financial management to generate benchmarks and assessments on the category's performance and market intelligence. Outputs like these help to inform our upcoming year's priorities based on the need to close gaps and ensure that the category meets its key performance indicators (KPIs) to improve spend under management, small business utilization, and cost avoidance.
                            </p>

                                I'm a 2019 Partnership for Public Service Federal IT Leaders program graduate and a Temple University alum (BA in Finance, MBA). I'm based in Philadelphia, and when it isn't football season, you'll find me trekking across some remote mountaintop or enjoying saltwater fishing. Go Eagles!

Before my current career in the Federal government, I served honorably in the U.S. Coast Guard for 23 years. When I retired as a Lieutenant Commander in 2001, I worked in the private sector at the executive level for over a decade before returning to the federal government and GSA in 2015.

                            As the director of the ITVMO, I have the unique opportunity to oversee the strategy, business, and operations and serve as the senior IT expert and authoritative technical consultant. The ITVMO serves as a trusted independent advisor and advocate to agencies - a one-stop shop, leveraging governmentwide IT procurement data, conducting market research, and developing shared agency acquisition knowledge to support agencies in procurement decisions.

                            This year, one of the more exciting service offerings we launched was Contract Review as a Service; by bringing together a team of domain experts in IT asset management, pricing, legal, and contract management, we can provide consultation to agency buyers on new contract documentation, reviews of existing agreements and contract data (e.g., enterprise licensing agreements; statement of works; audit strategies), and comparative analysis on like contracts across government and industry. The team is already working with a few select agencies as a pilot of this offering, looking at MSFT and Oracle.

                        Hi, my name is Kyra Stewart.<br>
                        I oversee day-to-day program operations as the IT Vendor Management Office Program Manager. I benefit from partnering with our dynamic and experienced team of subject matter experts and a broad range of partners on a vast set of topics, including vendor assessments, market, and procurement data analysis, IT category management, and more. I'm incredibly excited about leading the government-wide IT Buyers Community of Practice. It allows me to leverage my experience and passion for cross-functional collaboration, program and process improvement, and employee engagement while supporting government professionals who have the vital responsibility of procuring the IT resources needed to meet agency missions.
                      </p>
                      <p class="padding-top-3">
                        I initially joined the government as an Economist at the Department of Transportation. I went on to lead a hazardous materials grant program, held the role of Agency Ombudsperson, and served as the Agency Director of Innovation. In 2018, I was selected as a Fellow in the White House Leadership Development Program and invited to stay at the General Services Administration (GSA) after the program. At GSA, I worked with the Office of Government-wide Policy's Technology Business Management (TBM) PMO before being selected as the Program Manager for the new Federal ITVMO. With our government-wide focus, I can work across agencies and lines of business to identify and share best practices and lessons learned that ultimately result in government-wide IT acquisition improvements. I'm a 4th generation Washingtonian who attended National Cathedral High School for Girls in NW, DC. I earned my Bachelor's degree in Economics from the University of Virginia and later completed my Masters in Public Administration at American University. I've been with the Federal government for over 20 years and look forward to being part of the IT-driven evolution we will continue to experience in the government.

                        Hi, my name is Hello, I'm Heather Stier, and I’ve been supporting the federal government since 2008.  I started my career at the Department of State as a contractor supporting the enterprise wide IT Budget Management, Capitol Planning, and IT Strategy Planning.  In 2013,  I transitioned to a civil servant continuing to support the Department of State primarily focused on IT Strategic Planning and Budget management.  My role changed significantly in 2014 as I was appointed as the Contracting Officer Representative for over 10 of DOS’s enterprise IT contracts.  My journey with the federal government began in 2008. Since then I’ve held numerous roles and certificates including IT Specialist and Special Advisor to Leadership on Strategic Software Acquisitions as well as  being a certified FAC-COR Level III,  and FAC-P/PM Senior, and FAC/P/PM IT /FAC-P/PM Senior for. I was then offered an opportunity to take all of the unique IT, acquisition, and strategic planning experience I had gained at State and support the ITVMO as the   and Acquisition experience.  Before I settled into my current position as the ITVMO’s  IT Acquisition and Vendor Senior Advisor, I worked in the Department of State executing and overseeing many of the agency’s IT contracts.
