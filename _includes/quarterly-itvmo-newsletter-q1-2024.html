            Better Contracting Initiative
          </h3>
          <p class=" ">
            The Biden-Harris Administration recently has reinforced the <b>Governmentwide Category Management Framework</b>, with the launch of a new acquisition strategy focused on improving contracting -- the <b>Better Contracting Initiative (BCI)</b>. The BCI strategy includes leveraging data across agencies to get lower prices and better terms, negotiating common enterprise-wide software licenses, saving money and avoiding waste by getting contract requirements right the first time, and getting better value from sole source and other high-risk contracts.
          </p>
          <p class=" ">
            The ITVMO supports the BCI mission, working in tandem with the IT Category, part of the Federal Category Management Framework, to provide acquisition intelligence to support faster, smarter IT buying decisions. The ITVMO is doing this by building relationships with some of the government’s top original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), and agency IT Buyers to standardize contract terms and conditions, mitigate risks, and improve overall data quality for greater use by agencies in their acquisition strategies.
          </p>
          <p class=" ">
            In fiscal year 2022 the government spent $72B on IT, with more than 50% of that on software. Fiscal year 2023 is on target to be around the same. Federal agencies make significant investments when they enter into multi-year, enterprise contracts to acquire software made by top Original Equipment Manufacturers, or OEMs. For the OEMs, these deals represent some of the largest revenue commitments of their entire year. The OEMs and their resellers invest substantial resources in maximizing the value of these contracts to the sellers, maintaining a clear advantage over government buyers who are often understaffed and uninformed as to what constitutes a “good deal.” 
          </p>
          <p class=" ">
            This has and continues to result in price variation, vendor lock, and inability to operate across agencies. Recognizing this information disadvantage, the ITVMO has launched several initiatives to make better use of data by sharing market research and buying best practices across agencies.
          </p>
          <p class=" ">
            By providing this information, we’re helping agencies gain competence and confidence in their software contract investments. We’re also obtaining concessions with top OEMs to solve common purchasing challenges. To date, we’re 12 for 12 on concessions reached across 5 major OEMs. And, we’re working with federal policymakers and select OEMs to develop best-in-class terms to reduce price variances across the marketplace. This could result in a 2 to 5 percent cost avoidance governmentwide, that’s between $30 to $75 million!
          </p>
          <p class=" ">
            By working with agency buyers, we’re gaining valuable insights from their contract data to offer lessons learned for future investments and a more modern data-driven acquisition environment.
          </p>

            Category Management
          </h3>
          <p class=" ">
            Category Management is the practice of pre-negotiating contract terms through solutions like Best-in-Class, or BIC, vehicles. The IT BICs are contract solutions that provide the best value to the government. The purpose of category management is to drive a fundamental shift from managing purchases and prices individually across thousands of procurement units to managing entire categories of common spend and total cost.  The Information Technology Category has been identified as one of the 10 common categories of spend across the federal government.
          </p>
          <p class=" ">
            One of the measuring tools to determine a BIC designation is Spend Under Management (SUM).  Increasing SUM will decrease costs, contract duplication, and inefficiency leading to better buying outcomes. The BIC designation is assigned by the Office of Management and Budget as a preferred governmentwide solution that:
          </p>
          <p class=" ">
            <ul>
              <li>
                Allows acquisition experts to take advantage of pre-vetted, governmentwide contract solutions; Supports a government-wide migration to solutions that are mature and market-proven; and
              </li>
              <li>
                Assists in the optimization of spend, within the government-wide category management framework; and Increases the transactional data available for agency level and government-wide analysis of buying behavior.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p class=" ">
            The ITVMO in collaboration with the Governmentwide IT Category is creating a more diverse and resilient Federal IT Marketplace through these BICs. This past quarter, all thirteen of the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="/it-vehicles/">IT BIC Vehicle Solutions</a>, managed by <b>GSA</b>, <b>NASA</b>, <b>NIH</b>, and <b>DOD</b> were redesignated as <b>Best in Class (BIC) for FY24!</b> There are a total of <b>38 solutions</b> (that is right, IT makes up close to 40% of all BIC solutions) available governmentwide to boost <b>spend under management (SUM)</b>, increase <b>small business utilization</b>, and ensure <b>sustainable</b>, <b>secure solutions</b> are implemented. 
          </p>
          <p class=" ">
            Customer agencies can expect competitive pricing, well-managed administrative support, and credit for SUM when using a BIC vehicle. Additionally, this year, BICs will provide cost avoidance figures broken down by agencies, which will allow agencies to quantify the value of BIC solutions while <b>supporting Administrative priorities including Cyber, Climate, and Equity</b>. By increasing the utilization of BIC solutions across the Federal IT Marketplace, agencies ensure their acquisitions support governing policies and mandates.  
          </p>
          <p class=" ">
            The IT Category through the ITVMO will sustain the <b>Core Workstation Category Team (Core-WCT)</b> led by <b>NASA SEWP</b>. This team prepares and publishes the <b>Governmentwide Strategic Solutions (GSS)</b> for desktops and laptops annually. This year we will be on <b>GSS version 10</b>. For nine years, customers have had multiple system offerings available for purchase for each GSS category that meet or exceed the minimum specs that have been pre-screened and include value-added features and options. Terms and Conditions updated to drive value for the customer, including extended warranties and warehousing options, <b>EPEAT Gold, Energy Star, Section 508, TAA Conformance,</b> and delivery not to exceed 45 days. This year, the Core WCT will strive to increase awareness and visibility of the GSS Program throughout the year by <b>holding quarterly WCT meetings</b> so that agencies may offer their end-user computing devices requirements and review progress throughout the year. Research is underway to identify industry and government trends and requirements to determine if current GSS system categories need revision or additions, (e.g. Ruggedized systems). GSS v.10 will continue to make improvements in the shared GSS participating template to encourage more Industry participation
          </p>
          <p class=" ">
            The ITVMO as part of the larger Category Management Framework is also actively working with the <b>Federal Acquisition Programs</b> at <b>GSA</b>, <b>NASA</b>, <b>NIH</b>, and <b>DoD</b> to ensure vehicles maintain designation status and that a <b>new wave of buying practices</b> are continuously assessed and introduced to the Federal IT Marketplace. NASA SEWP published the draft RFP in October. SEWP VI is expected to be awarded by May 2025. NITAAC has extended the CIO-SP3 and CIO-SP3 Small Business GWACs through 4/29/2024. This ensures there is no break of service during the award of CIO-SP4 and continued coverage for NITAAC agency partners who use our contracting vehicles. GSA Polaris GSA issued a Question & Response #8 of the Polaris Small Business Pool in November. Polaris will be a small business governmentwide acquisition contract (GWAC) for acquiring customized information technology (IT) services and IT services-based solutions.

            Safe and Secure Use of AI
          </h3>
          <p class=" ">
            On Oct 30, 2023 the Biden-Harris Administration issued an Executive Order on the “Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence.” The E.O. advances the safe, responsible, and ethical use of AI by federal agencies while safeguarding consumers and proactively mitigating potential risks through established regulatory powers. In short, the E.O. charges over 50 federal organizations with more than 100 distinct actions across eight main principles - 
            <ol>
              <li>Safety and security</li>
              <li>Innovation, collaboration, and competition</li>
              <li>American worker support</li>
              <li>Consideration of AI bias and civil rights and Equity</li>
              <li>Consumer protection</li>
              <li>Privacy and civil liberties</li>
              <li>Federal AI use</li>
              <li>International leadership in AI development</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <p class=" ">
            The E.O. emphasizes the need to regulate high-risk AI and acknowledges the intricate relationship between AI and privacy. It pledges federal backing for the advancement and adoption of privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) while mandating agencies to assess their utilization of commercially available data containing personally identifiable information, including data sourced from data brokers.
          </p>
          <p class=" ">
            While a substantial portion of the Executive Order centers on developing standards and guidelines, it also includes several concrete steps assigned to agencies. <b>The ITVMO is working with agencies to understand and disseminate this information as it develops.</b>
          </p>
          <p class=" ">
            Key directives include Mandating NIST to establish pre-deployment red-team testing standards for AI foundation models. This work is expected to build on the previous NIST’s current <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://airc.nist.gov/AI_RMF_Knowledge_Base/Playbook">AI Risk Management framework</a>. NIST recently issued <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/226/ipd">Guidelines for Evaluating Differential Privacy Guarantees</a> and has an <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2023/12/nist-calls-information-support-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and">open call RFI</a> to gather information to support its response to the Executive Order on AI. To keep abreast and engage further visit the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nist.gov/artificial-intelligence/nist-ai-engagement">NIST AI Engagement page</a>.
          </p>
          <p class=" ">
            The E.O. also places significant emphasis on expeditiously hiring AI professionals (set to be completed within 60 days of Oct. 30) and providing AI training for existing employees. OPM’s December 29th <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://chcoc.gov/content/government-wide-hiring-authorities-advancing-federal-government-use-artificial-intelligence">memo</a> grants <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/hiring-information/direct-hire-authority/#url=Fact-Sheet">direct hire authority</a> where appropriate, and considers the use of excepted service appointments to support the administration’s AI actions. 
          </p>
          <p class=" ">
            <b>It requires agencies to devise more efficient procurement processes for AI and conduct further studies on enhancing AI utilization within the federal government.</b> Keep an eye on <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.dhs.gov/publication/pil">The Procurement Information Lab (PIL)</a> a DHS framework aimed at experimenting with innovative acquisition techniques across the DHS enterprise, and <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://itvmo.gsa.gov/">the ITVMO</a> for upcoming guidance on procurement and acquisition. 
          </p>
          <p class=" ">
            In addition to addressing the above concerns, the order recognizes ethical concerns and the potential for civil rights infringements linked with AI and automated decision-making and instructs the Attorney General to take measures to mitigate algorithmic bias and other civil rights violations stemming from AI usage. The <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://rai.tradewindai.com/">Responsible AI Toolkit</a> builds on <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.diu.mil/responsible-ai-guidelines">DoD Responsible AI guidelines</a>.
          </p>
          <p class=" ">
            The E.O. also specifically highlights the harm AI could cause to small businesses and includes actions to address risks such as preventing dominant firms from disadvantaging competitors and working to provide new opportunities for small businesses and entrepreneurs. The Administrator of the Small Business Administration will be required to conduct outreach and raise awareness of, opportunities for small businesses to use capital-access programs eligible for AI-related purposes. The SBA has already scheduled an upcoming event on <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.sba.gov/event/40412">How to use Artificial Intelligence in your Business: A Step-by-Step Guide</a>.  The ITVMO is cohosting a small business event on February 29, 2024, called, <b>Empowering Small Business: A Matchmaking Event. Register <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.actiac.org/act-iac-event/empowering-small-business-matchmaking-event">here</a>.</b>
          </p>
          <p class=" ">
            While the primary focus of these initiatives is on federal agencies, their effects will inevitably extend to private sector businesses as they try to recruit AI professionals, participate in federal contracts, and navigate nondiscrimination regulations.  Companies contracting with the federal government will be subject to regulation and monitor evolving standards and guidelines, such as watermarking standards by the Department of Commerce, AI risk assessment efforts by the Department of Energy, and the requirement for developers of specific AI systems to disclose information to the government about model training and share outcomes of red-team safety assessments.
          </p>
          <p class=" ">
            <b>The ITVMO in collaboration with industry and government has put together a comprehensive program of resources, including a series of informational videos on recent EOs and Memos (coming soon), and dedicated panels at the ITVMO Annual Summit in April (<a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1w31uu2jPorkd4HTCDM_-w4BMXb67eQpvLLZBJ_wq_Yc/edit">pre-register here</a>) which will bring together leadership to discuss the technology, people, and process side of operationalizing and implementing various aspects of the E.O. </b>

            The Biden administration has released a proposed rule as part of its Federal Sustainability Plan, aimed at revising the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to establish new requirements for “sustainable procurement” in federal contracting, encouraging federal government buyers to prioritize sustainable products and services.
          </p>
          <p class=" ">
            OMB’s Office of Federal Procurement Policy and CEQ’s Office of the Chief Federal Sustainability Officer has requested the U.S. EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) EPP (Environmentally Preferable Purchasing) Team, and the sustainability representatives working with the Category Management teams to review the appropriate contract documents for each BIC (Best in Class) contract against the sustainability clauses as outlined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).
          </p>
          <p class=" ">
            The Information Technology Category was assigned a point of contact from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to conduct the assessment of contract solutions for all 13 IT Best-In-Class vehicles. The Sustainability Check was based on a match between the types of products and/or services sold via these BICs and FAR sustainability requirements that apply to these product/service types in connection with the IT spend category. 
          </p>
