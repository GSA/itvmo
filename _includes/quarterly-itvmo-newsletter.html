        ITVMO 2024 Summit Recap: A Resounding Success in Revolutionizing
        Government Acquisitions
      </h3>
      <p class=" ">
        The 2024 ITVMO Summit, focused on "Revolutionizing Government
        Acquisitions through Digital Transformation," was a resounding success,
        with record-breaking attendance and overwhelmingly positive feedback.
        The event brought together nearly 200 government and industry
        professionals for insightful discussions and networking opportunities.
      </p>

      <p class=" ">
        Key highlights included keynote speeches from influential figures like
        Jason Miller Deputy Director for Management, Office of Management and
        Budget, Christine Harada (Senior Advisor, Office of Federal Procurement
        Policy), and Jeff Koses (Senior Procurement Executive - General Services
        Administration), as well as engaging panel discussions on emerging
        technologies, procurement practices, and the importance of partnerships.
        Attendees also had the chance to connect with government-wide partners
        and access a comprehensive suite of ITVMO resources.
      </p>

      <p class=" ">
        Feedback from participants was overwhelmingly positive, with 100% rating
        the event as very good or excellent and expressing a desire to attend
        again next year. The networking sessions and speaker presentations were
        particularly valued, and suggestions for future improvements included
        more breakout groups and a longer event.
      </p>

      <p class=" ">
        The summit's success underscores its importance as a platform for
        collaboration and knowledge sharing in the federal IT marketplace. The
        ITVMO continues to play a crucial role in driving innovation and
        efficiency in government acquisitions, and the 2024 summit has further
        solidified its position as a leader in the field.

      <h3 id="hackathon" class="itvmo-article-sub-2">ITVMO Hackathon</h3>

      <p class=" ">
        The ITVMO is hosting a Procurement Hackathon to spark innovation,
        identify new approaches, and engage government and industry
        practitioners in addressing federal IT marketplace procurement
        challenges. The ITVMO Procurement Hackathon is modeled after traditional
        hackathons focusing on solving procurement challenges.
      </p>
      <p class=" ">
        Through this 1-day virtual workshop, participants from government and
        industry will collaborate to identify and work through procurement
        challenges using their expertise and experience on both sides of the
        procurement process. Participants will then have the opportunity to
        present their findings to an audience of other practitioners, experts,

      <p class=" ">
        The role of IT is shifting from end-user service to a more holistic,
        change-making offering. One priority in leading successful digital
        transformation is strengthening the partnership between government and
        industry. With limited budgets and resources, we must determine what to
        prioritize first. We need to use a whole-of-government approach to help
        find ways to strengthen, accelerate, and/or streamline critical
        procurement processes like the Request for Information (RFI) and Request
        for Proposal (RFP) processes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b> Why Prioritize Transformation of the RFI/RFP Process: </b>
      </p>

        <ul class="experiences">
          <li class="bulletText tight-bullet">
            <b>Effectiveness - </b>
            Creating better alignment with agency mission needs by clearly
            defining desired outcomes in the RFI/RFP. Creating clearer
            communication and evaluation processes reduces the risk of
            misunderstandings and project failures associated with poorly
            defined requirements.
          </li>
          <li class="bulletText tight-bullet">
            <b>Quality - </b>
            Developing and communicating objective evaluation criteria to ensure
            all proposals are assessed fairly and consistently. Leveraging
            technology for tasks like standardized terms and conditions and
            process workflows.

          <li class="bulletText tight-bullet">
            <b>Efficiency - </b>
            Streamlining processes can help to improve clarity and
            understanding. In modernizing the RFI/RFP processes we can
            facilitate better communication and collaboration between agencies
            and vendors. This can lead to a clearer understanding of needs,
            resulting in more targeted proposals and ultimately, better
            outcomes.

      <p class=" ">
        The Information Technology Vendor Management Office (ITVMO) is taking
        significant strides to promote equity and diversity within the federal
        IT software reseller marketplace. By addressing barriers to entry and
        growth for small and Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDBs), the ITVMO
        aims to create a more inclusive and competitive landscape.

        Improving Small Business Utilization

        The ITVMO is actively collaborating with federal agencies to increase
        the utilization of small businesses, inclusive of all socio-economic
        statuses in IT procurement.
      </p>

      <p class=" ">

      <p class=" ">
        This collaborative effort aims to enhance agencies' Spend Under
        Management (SUM) and Small Business Utilization Key Performance
        Indicators (KPIs). By leveraging the ITVMO's expertise and resources,
        agencies can more effectively engage with small vendors, fostering a
        more diverse and competitive IT marketplace. This initiative not only
        supports the growth and success of small businesses but also ensures
        that federal agencies benefit from the innovation and agility they bring
        to the table. By partnering with agencies, the ITVMO is helping to
        create a more equitable and prosperous future for all stakeholders
        involved in government IT procurement.
      </p>

      <p class=" ">
        In addition, the ITVMO is exploring avenues to amplify small business
        utilization within the IT Government-wide Categoryâ€™s 13 IT Best-in-Class
        (BIC) contract solutions. This includes partnering with ACT-IAC on an
        FY25 IT Government-wide Category Forum scheduled for October 2024, see

          Ms. Heather Stier's career is marked by her unwavering dedication to

          emphasis on IT Strategic Planning and Budget Management.
          <br />
          <br />
          In 2014, Heatherâ€™s career shifted significantly when she was appointed

        cherished since the early 80s. She is actively involved in local feline
        rescues, often adopting and fostering furry companions, and enjoys
