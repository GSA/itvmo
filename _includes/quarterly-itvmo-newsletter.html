        ITVMO Annual Assessment
      </h3>
      <p class=" ">
        As we look back on FY24 here at the Information Technology Vendor
        Management Office (ITVMO), we want to recognize the IT industry and
        procurement workforce for their relentless commitment and
        professionalism, and the incredible value they bring to the acquisition
        community. Their efforts ensure the government has the technology it
        needs to serve the American people.

        Technology touches every facet of government operations, from powering
        public safety and health services to enabling infrastructure, education,
        and more. This interconnected system relies on the dedication and
        expertise of both government and industry to drive innovation and
        deliver meaningful outcomes. The IT procurement community plays a
        pivotal role in this ecosystem, ensuring that agencies have access to
        the smart, secure solutions needed to achieve their missions. Though
        much of this work happens behind the scenes, its ripple effects are seen
        and felt across the nation, advancing public service and mission
        delivery.
      </p>

      <p class=" ">
        Looking ahead, the ITVMO remains steadfast in its commitment to support
        this vital collaboration. Our mission is clear: to partner with the IT
        industry and empower the acquisition workforce with the tools,
        strategies, and innovations they need to thrive. Whether refining
        acquisition technologies, streamlining procurement processes, or
        fostering meaningful connections between government and industry, our
        initiatives are designed to meet the dynamic challenges of IT
        procurement with confidence and precision.
      </p>

      <p class=" ">
        Together, we are shaping a future where government and industry work
        hand in hand to harness technology’s transformative power—driving
        smarter, faster, and more impactful results for all.
      </p>

      <p class=" ">
        Thanks to the support and expertise of many of you, the ITVMO achieved
        several impactful milestones in 2024. Together, we’re strengthening
        acquisition practices, promoting financial management, and enhancing
        digital engagement across federal IT.

        Hackathon Teams Tackle Key Procurement Challenges
      </h3>

      <p class=" ">
        In an exciting collaboration between government and industry, the ITVMO
        hosted a highly successful Procurement Hackathon that brought together
        procurement professionals and thought leaders from across government and
        industry to tackle some of the most pressing challenges facing the
        federal procurement system.
      </p>
      <p class=" ">
        Prior to the event, participants and IT Buyers CoP members identified
        critical issues impacting procurement speed, efficiency, and technology
        adoption. Armed with these insights, nine teams collaborated intensively
        during the ITVMO Procurement Hackathon, focusing on the themes of
        <b>People</b>, <b>Process</b>, and <b>Technology</b>. Below are just a
        selection of the many standout ideas that emerged:

            mentorship environment to enhance acquisition skills. By offering
            practical, hands-on learning, the program aims to supplement

        Enhancing Small Business Participation in the Federal IT Software
        Reseller Market
      </h3>
      <p class=" ">
        The ITVMO, recently undertook an initiative to expand opportunities for
        small businesses (SBs) in federal IT contract spending focusing on small
        business participation within the OEM-VAR landscape. Federal agencies
        acquire a significant portion of commercial software through Value-Added
        Resellers (VARs); however, small business participation in this market
        varies widely depending on the practices of OEMs.
      </p>

      <p class=" ">
        Recognizing this gap, a study was launched to better understand the
        challenges small businesses face in entering and thriving in the federal
        marketplace and to examine inconsistencies in OEM management of their
        VAR networks.
      </p>

      <p class=" ">
        The initiative kicked off with a Request for Information (RFI), inviting
        insights and feedback from stakeholders across the IT industry.
      </p>

      <p class=" ">
        The ITVMO would like to extend our sincere thanks to the 40+ industry
        partners who responded to the OEM and VAR Vendor Assessment Initiative
        RFI. The insights gained have provided us with a deeper understanding of
        the challenges and opportunities small businesses face in the federal IT
        marketplace. This work helps direct the ITVMO’s efforts, ensuring
        resources are strategically aligned to address key challenges that drive
        meaningful improvements.

        Challenges Faced by Small Businesses
      </h3>
      <p class="mt-0">
        RFI respondents outlined several challenges faced when entering and
        growing in the federal marketplace. Some of the most common roadblocks
        highlighted included:

      <div class="bulletSections">
        <div class="topLine"></div>
        <ul class="experiences">
          <li class="bulletText tight-bullet">
            Building effective relationships with OEMs: Businesses, particularly
            small businesses, struggle to build the formal relationships the
            federal government requires to act as resellers.
          </li>
          <li class="bulletText tight-bullet">
            The complexities of navigating federal contract vehicles:
            Understanding of the contracts federal agencies use and visibility
            into federal VAR opportunities remains limited, hindering growth and
            participation
          </li>
          <li class="bulletText tight-bullet">
            The inconsistent application of size standards: Businesses reported
            they are considered small on some contracts, but not on others. This
            complicates the competitive environment.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h3 class="itvmo-article-sub-3-blue mb-0">Our Commitment to Action</h3>

      <p class="mt-0">
        In response, the ITVMO is committed to taking actionable steps to
        improve the reseller market based on feedback in the RFI, with the goal
        of enhancing small business participation in federal IT procurement.
        We’ve increased opportunities for businesses to learn about the federal
        OEM marketplace. For example, we've begun hosting training sessions on
        federal contract vehicles, including a recent session via the Minority
        Business Development Agency (MBDA), and we have an upcoming session on
        GSA's FAS Lane and Springboard Programs scheduled for December 10. These
        training programs are designed to increase the understanding of
        governmentwide contracts, helping small businesses better navigate the
        procurement process.
      </p>
      <p class=" ">
        Looking ahead, we’ll host matchmaking events in early 2025 to connect
        OEMs and VARs, further strengthening these vital relationships.
        Additionally, we are actively working with policymakers to explore ways
        to improve consistency in the use of NAICS codes, enhancing transparency
        in the marketplace. These initiatives are part of our broader strategy
        to streamline the OEM-VAR relationship-building process and make it
        easier for reseller businesses in the federal marketplace to access
        federal contracts.

          Peng has dedicated 14 years to federal service and currently provides
          counsel to the ITVMO and the IT Government-Wide Category, overseeing
          more than $78 billion in obligations. This category includes 13 Best
          in Class IT Acquisition contract solutions operated by NASA, DoD, GSA,
          and HHS' NIH. Peng is part of an exceptional team that develops and
          executes interagency initiatives to promote the federal government's
          premier IT solutions and support American small businesses.

        Peng's expertise lies in program and category management and process
        improvement. A key ongoing project involves developing the IT
        Government-wide Category’s strategic plan for FY25. In this role, Peng
        leads a team of domain experts in data and IT financial management to
        produce benchmarks and performance assessments. These outputs inform the
        priorities for the coming year, ensuring the category meets its key
        performance indicators (KPIs) for improving spend under management,
        increasing small business utilization, and achieving cost avoidance.
      </p>
      <p class=" ">
        A 2019 Partnership for Public Service Federal IT Leaders program
        graduate, Peng holds a BA in Finance and an MBA from Temple University.
