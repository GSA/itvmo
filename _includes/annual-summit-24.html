                    profound technological shifts in a generation or more. At

                    IT. Contracting officials should consider cybersecurity,

                    standards and guidelines when procuring Generative AI just

                    - In May 2021, the Biden Administration issued an executive
                    order aimed at enhancing the nation's cybersecurity.
                    Executive Order (EO) 14028 mandates a significant shift in
                    how the US federal government approaches cybersecurity. A
                    key pillar of this initiative is the adoption of a Zero
                    Trust security model.

                    - Cyberspace is particularly difficult to secure due to a
                    number of factors: the ability of malicious actors to
                    operate from anywhere in the world, the linkages between
                    cyberspace and physical systems, and the difficulty of
                    reducing vulnerabilities and consequences in complex cyber
                    networks. Implementing safe cybersecurity best practices is
                    important for individuals as well as organizations of all
                    sizes.

                  sought/RFI to RFP/RFQ process is burdensome both to government
                  and industry parties involved. Join our closing track to hear
                  about the ITVMO’s new initiative launching to determine
                  opportunities for modernizing this process by examining
                  policies, processes, people (or roles), and technologies that
                  are interdependent on its execution and ways we can do better
                  as a marketplace. We want to hear from you and hope you can
