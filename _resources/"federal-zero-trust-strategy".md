description: "Federal Zero Trust Strategy: sets forth a Federal zero trust
  architecture (ZTA) strategy, requiring agencies to meet specific cybersecurity
  standards and objectives by the end of Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 in order to
  reinforce the Governmentâ€™s defenses against increasingly sophisticated and
  persistent threat campaigns. Those campaigns target Federal technology
  infrastructure, threatening public safety and privacy, damaging the American
  economy, and weakening trust in Government."
