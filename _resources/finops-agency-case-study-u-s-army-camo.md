title: "FinOps - Agency Case Study: U.S. Army - CAMO"
description: In 2019, the U.S. Army stood up the EnterpriseCloudManagementAgency
  (ECMA) to kickstart cloud migration. ECMA identified and satisfied the
  requirement for a prototype process to help the Army effectively plan, budget,
  and consume commercial cloud services. In March 2021, ECMA awarded the
  CloudAccount ManagementOptimization (CAMO) Agreement to begin the Armyâ€™s cloud
  journey by providing Cloud Service Provider (CSP) reselling services to the
  Army. CAMO was initiated as an Other Transaction Authority (OTA) to experiment
  with industry partners to bring multi-cloud products and services to the Army
  with best possible pricing and without excessive toil by the customer. CAMO
  demonstrates the value of an enterprise solution which incentivizes
  appropriate behaviors, provides tangible value to the user base and Army,
  creates visibility of utilization and investments, and creates long term cost
  avoidance when compared to alternatives.
