title: Federal Zero Trust Data Security Guide
description: >-
  This document was developed by the Zero Trust (ZT) Data Security Working Group
  in furtherance of its directive under the Office of Management and Budget
  (OMB) Memorandum M-22-09, Moving the U.S. Government Towards Zero Trust
  Cybersecurity Principles. The Working Group is a joint committee comprised of
  members from the Federal Chief Data Officer (CDO) Council and Chief
  Information Security Officer (CISO) Council, as well as other Federal
  stakeholders.


  OMB M-22-09 charges the Working Group with developing a guide for Federal agencies that addresses how existing Federal information categorization schemes can support effective data categorization in a security context. It also focuses on developing enterprise-specific data categories not addressed by existing Federal categories, identifying members to act as leads or designate leads within their agencies to convene a community of practice (CoP) for specific areas of focus, and supporting pilots of emerging approaches and best practices among agencies.


  This document is intended to assist agencies on their ZT journey as they continue to implement ZT principles year-to-year and across Administrations.
