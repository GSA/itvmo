title: "M-23-16, Update to Memorandum M-22-18, Enhancing the Security of the Software Supply Chain through Secure Software Development Practices "
description: "Deadlines are extended for agencies to collect attestations from software producers. Critical software attestations are due 3 months after OMB approves the common attestation form. All software attestations are due 6 months after approval.
Attestations only need to come from the producer of the end software product used by an agency, not creators of incorporated third-party components. Freely obtained, public domain proprietary software is excluded from attestation requirements. Whether contractor-developed software requires attestations depends on the agency's involvement in the full development lifecycle. If a producer cannot attest, agencies can accept a POA&M documenting risk mitigation practices and must request a deadline extension from OMB. Agencies must discontinue software use if no extension is approved."
