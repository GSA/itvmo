title: "Cybersecurity: Improvements Needed in Addressing Risks to Operational
  Technology"
description: The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) report, published
  on March 7, 2024, addresses the cybersecurity risks to operational technology
  (OT) systems, which are crucial for controlling processes and production in
  critical infrastructure, such as oil pipelines. The report highlights the
  significant threat cyberattacks pose to these systems. It evaluates the
  Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency's (CISA) efforts in providing
  technical assistance to critical infrastructure owners and operators to
  mitigate these risks. Despite some positive feedback, challenges persist,
  including insufficient staffing with the necessary skills at CISA and delays
  in addressing reported vulnerabilities. The GAO recommends that CISA improve
  its workforce planning and customer service measurement to better address OT
  cybersecurity risks. Additionally, the report identifies challenges in
  collaboration between CISA and other agencies, noting that CISA has not fully
  adopted leading collaboration practices. To enhance its support for OT
  cybersecurity, the GAO makes four recommendations aimed at improving CISA's
  products, services, and collaboration efforts. The Department of Homeland
  Security (DHS) has concurred with these recommendations and outlined plans for
  their implementation.
