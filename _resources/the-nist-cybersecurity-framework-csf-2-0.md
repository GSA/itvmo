title: The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0
description: The Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0 is crafted to assist entities
  across various sectors—industry, government, academia, and nonprofits—in
  managing and mitigating cybersecurity risks, irrespective of their
  cybersecurity program's maturity or technical sophistication. It acknowledges
  the diversity of organizations' risks, risk appetites, missions, and
  objectives, advocating for a tailored implementation rather than a
  one-size-fits-all solution. The CSF aims to integrate cybersecurity risk
  management with other organizational risks such as financial, privacy, and
  supply chain risks. It outlines broad, sector-agnostic outcomes to guide
  executives and practitioners alike, offering flexibility to address unique
  organizational needs. This latest version, CSF 2.0, introduces enhancements
  focusing on governance, supply chains, and accessibility for smaller
  organizations, complemented by Implementation Examples and Informative
  References available online. This framework encourages organizations to
  evaluate their cybersecurity stance contextually and adapt the CSF
  accordingly, facilitating a more efficient assessment and implementation of
  security controls.
