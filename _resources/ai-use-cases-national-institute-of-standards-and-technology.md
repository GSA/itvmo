title: AI Use Cases National Institute of Standards and Technology
description: "The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has
  taken steps to align with Executive Order 13960: Promoting the Use of
  Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in the Federal Government. As required by
  the executive order, NIST annually prepares an inventory of its
  non-classified, non-sensitive, and non-research use cases of AI. However, as
  of the current update, NIST has reported that it does not have any operational
  use cases that meet the scope of this Executive Order. This proactive approach
  by NIST reflects its commitment to the responsible and transparent use of AI,
  ensuring that the technology is used in a manner that is safe, secure, and
  trustworthy, aligning with the broader goals of the executive order."
