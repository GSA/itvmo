title: Energy Act of 2020 IT Sustainability Best Practice Guide
description: >-
  In 2021, President Biden's Executive Order 14057 positioned the Federal
  Government as a sustainability leader, aiming to significantly reduce U.S.
  greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and achieve net-zero emissions procurement by
  2050. The accompanying Federal Sustainability Plan outlines strategies in key
  areas like electricity, vehicles, and infrastructure to meet these targets.


  To support these goals, the Energy Act of 2020 mandated the Federal Chief Information Officers (CIO) Council to develop sustainable practices for IT management. The IT Sustainability Best Practices Guide, aligned with EO 14057, provides comprehensive recommendations to integrate IT modernization with sustainability efforts. This guide, informed by industry research and expert insights from the OMB, CIO Council, and General Services Administration (GSA), offers federal agencies a roadmap to enhance IT sustainability, contributing significantly to the broader sustainability objectives of the Federal Government. The implementation of these practices ensures a unified and cost-effective approach to IT sustainability across federal agencies, reinforcing the U.S.'s commitment to global sustainability leadership.
