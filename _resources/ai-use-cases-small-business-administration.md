description: >-
  The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) has conducted a review of its
  Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) systems in response to
  Executive Order (EO) 13960, ""Promoting the Use of Trustworthy Artificial
  Intelligence in the Federal Government."" This review aimed to identify any
  use cases of Artificial Intelligence (AI) within the agency.


  As per the information provided, the SBA did not identify any AI use cases in its current operations. The agency has committed to continuously monitoring its systems and will update the public AI use case inventory as needed to ensure transparency and adherence to the directives of the executive order. This proactive approach demonstrates the SBA's commitment to responsible governance and the thoughtful integration of AI technologies in its operations.
