title: Dual-Use Foundation Models with Widely Available Model Weights Report
description: On October 30, 2023, President Biden signed an executive order
  focused on the safe and trustworthy development of AI. It directs the
  Secretary of Commerce, through NTIA, to gather feedback from various
  stakeholders on the risks, benefits, and regulatory approaches for dual-use AI
  models with widely available weights. NTIA released a Request for Comment in
  February 2024 and hosted public events to collect input. The findings were
  compiled into a report for the President, offering policy and regulatory
  recommendations.
