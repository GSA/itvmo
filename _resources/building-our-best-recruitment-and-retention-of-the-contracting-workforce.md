title: "Building our Best: Recruitment and Retention of the Contracting Workforce"
description: Last year, the Federal Government purchased over $750 billion in
  goods and services through contracts awarded by tens of thousands of
  acquisition professionals. These professionals' business acumen, analytical
  and research skills, and judgment are critical to the success of agency
  missions. As the largest buyer of goods and services globally, the Federal
  Government depends heavily on this workforce—the cornerstone of a successful
  federal acquisition system—to deliver best-value solutions and ensure the
  system benefits all Americans. To maintain a strong pipeline of acquisition
  talent at all levels and meet future challenges, this memorandum establishes a
  blueprint for prioritizing the recruitment and retention of contracting
  professionals.
