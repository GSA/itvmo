  Modernization Cybersecurity Implementation Plan to Secure an Ambitious Energy
  Future"
description: The Office of the National Cyber Director (ONCD) has released the
  Energy Modernization Cybersecurity Implementation Plan (EMCIP) to enhance the
  security of America's increasingly digitized energy infrastructure. As the
  energy sector adopts internet-connected technologies to improve efficiency and
  resilience, the potential attack surface for adversaries expands. EMCIP
  outlines coordinated actions between government and private sectors to
  safeguard modern energy systems against cybersecurity threats. This initiative
  aligns with findings from the nation's first Report on the Cybersecurity
  Posture of the United States, emphasizing the need for robust defenses in
  critical infrastructure.
