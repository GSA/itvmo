title: "Cloud Computing: Agencies Need to Address Key OMB Procurement Requirements"
description: >-
  In 2019, the Office of Management and Budget established 5 key requirements
  for agencies related to procuring secure, cost-effective cloud services.


  As of July 2024, the 24 major agencies set policies and guidance that addressed some of these requirements but not others. For example, all the agencies had established guidance to ensure their chief information officer oversees agency modernization efforts.


  But most hadn't established guidance on service level agreementsâ€”which define the levels of service and performance the agency expects its cloud providers to meet.
