title: "BOD 25-01: Implementing Secure Practices for Cloud Services Required
  Configurations"
description: >-
  On December 17, 2024, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency
  (CISA) issued Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 25-01: Implementing Secure
  Practices for Cloud Services. Through the Secure Cloud Business Applications
  (SCuBA) project, CISA has developed Secure Configuration Baselines to provide
  consistent, effective, and manageable cloud security configurations, as well
  as assessment tools that allows agencies and CISA to improve the security of
  Federal Civilian Executive Branch assets hosted in cloud environments. 


  BOD 25-01 requires all Federal Civilian Executive Branch agencies to comply with a defined set of these Secure Cloud Baselines, deploy automated configuration assessment tools to check compliance, and to remediate deviations from these policies under BOD 25-01. 


  Although BOD 25-01 only requires action by Federal Civilian Executive Branch agencies, CISA strongly recommends all stakeholders implement these policies and leverage CISAâ€™s SCuBA assessment tool and the information on this page. Doing so will reduce significant risk and enhance collective resilience across the cybersecurity community.
