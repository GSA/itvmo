title: FedRAMP's Role In The AI Executive Order
description: >-
  Discusses the FedRAMP's role in implementing the Executive Order (EO) on Safe,
  Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI),
  issued by the White House on October 30, 2023. The EO aims to support a wide
  range of activities across the federal government, focusing on the safe,
  secure, and trustworthy development and use of AI. FedRAMP is tasked with
  establishing strategies for authorizing emerging technologies, particularly
  cloud-based AI-related products. This is to ensure that agencies have the
  necessary tools to serve the public more effectively.


  The organization is working closely with stakeholders from both the commercial and federal sectors. It is also coordinating with the FedRAMP Board, the Office of Management & Budget, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the Federal Secure Cloud Advisory Committee to create and agree on an authorization strategy for emerging technologies.
