  Management Requirements
description: The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued Memorandum
  M-25-04, outlining Fiscal Year 2025 requirements for federal information
  security and privacy management. The guidance rescinds M-24-04 and aligns with
  the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014, emphasizing
  continued implementation of the National Cybersecurity Strategy. It focuses on
  advancing zero trust architectures, modernizing FedRAMP to support secure
  cloud adoption, and integrating FedRAMP Marketplace data into FISMA reporting
  for a comprehensive cloud service inventory. Agencies are also directed to
  incorporate performance measurement strategies into resource requests to
  ensure effective assessment of cybersecurity investments.
