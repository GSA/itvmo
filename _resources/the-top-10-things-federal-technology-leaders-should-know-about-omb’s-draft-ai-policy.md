title: The Top 10 Things Federal Technology Leaders Should Know About OMB’s
  Draft AI Policy
description: The U.S. Chief Information Officers Council's guidance on OMB’s
  Draft AI Policy outlines the top ten aspects federal technology leaders should
  be aware of regarding this policy. The policy emphasizes responsible AI use in
  government, with a focus on enhancing services and promoting equity. It
  introduces the role of Chief AI Officers for AI governance and risk
  management, mandates AI Governance Boards in CFO Act agencies, and stipulates
  AI risk management requirements for safety- or rights-impacting AI uses. The
  policy also addresses the integration of AI risk management into existing
  processes and highlights the importance of managing generative AI use.
  Additionally, the policy will apply to federal contractors, and further
  guidance is anticipated. The final policy is under development with public and
  interagency input.
