title: Implementation of Executive Order Requirements Is Essential to Address
  Key Actions
description: Federal IT systems are intricate, diverse, and dispersed across
  locations, complicating their security management. For over 25 years, the
  Government Accountability Office (GAO) has highlighted information security as
  a high-risk area for government operations, expanding its focus to include
  critical infrastructure protection and privacy of personal data. In 2021, the
  President issued Executive Order 14028 to bolster the government's
  cybersecurity response. The Federal Information Security Modernization Act
  (FISMA) mandates periodic reports to Congress on federal cybersecurity
  practices. A recent GAO report assessed federal agencies’ adherence to the
  executive order’s cybersecurity leadership and oversight requirements,
  identifying significant areas of progress and ongoing challenges. The analysis
  involved reviewing 55 specific leadership and oversight directives, evaluating
  their implementation, and discussing cybersecurity strategies with federal
  chief information security officers to identify critical areas needing
  attention.
