title: "Digital Experience: Agency Compliance with Statutory Requirements"
description: >-
  Public-facing federal websites should be user-friendly. To achieve this, the
  21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act requires federal agencies to
  ensure their websites meet 8 modernization requirements. For example, websites
  should be accessible, mobile-friendly, and searchable.


  How did agencies do in 2023?


  We looked at 24 large agencies that provide high-impact services through their websites. About a third of them reported making progress on all the requirements. The rest either reported progress on some requirements, none, or didn't submit reports.
