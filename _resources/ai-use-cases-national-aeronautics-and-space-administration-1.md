title: AI Use Cases National Aeronautics and Space Administration
description: NASA has updated its AI Use Case inventory for 2023, following a
  process similar to the previous year. The inventory was compiled with input
  from NASA's Community of Practice of researchers, utilizing a newly deployed
  web tool. The list represents projects where NASA is currently employing AI
  tools developed in-house, with many of the AI activities being in the
  formulation phase or still under development. NASA's commitment to AI reflects
  its broader mission to explore the unknown, innovate for the benefit of
  humanity, and inspire the world through discovery. The AI inventory is a
  testament to NASA's dedication to advancing the frontiers of knowledge and
  technology.
