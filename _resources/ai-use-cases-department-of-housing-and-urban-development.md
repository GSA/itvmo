title: AI Use Cases Department of Housing and Urban Development
description: >-
  The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has complied with
  Executive Order (EO) 13960, ""Promoting the Use of Trustworthy Artificial
  Intelligence in the Federal Government,"" by inventorying its Artificial
  Intelligence (AI) use cases. The department has identified a significant AI
  use case:


  Consolidated Plan Pilot Analysis: Initiated in March 2023, the Planning Development and Research (PD&R) began a pilot project to analyze aspects of HUD's Consolidated Plans. These plans are essential as they identify and assess affordable housing and community development needs and market conditions. They are submitted by grantees of HUD's formula block grant programs and are publicly available on HUD's website. This AI use case reflects HUD's commitment to leveraging technology to improve its services and operations, ensuring that housing and urban development programs are as effective and efficient as possible.
