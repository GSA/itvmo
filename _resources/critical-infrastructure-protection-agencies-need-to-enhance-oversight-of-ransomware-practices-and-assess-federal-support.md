title: "Critical Infrastructure Protection: Agencies Need to Enhance Oversight
  of Ransomware Practices and Assess Federal Support"
description: "This U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) report highlights
  the critical need for enhanced oversight of ransomware practices within four
  key sectors: manufacturing, energy, healthcare and public health, and
  transportation systems. It points out that although federal agencies have
  assessed or plan to assess risks associated with ransomware, they have not
  fully evaluated the adoption of leading cybersecurity practices or the
  effectiveness of federal support in mitigating these risks. The report
  underlines the devastating impacts of ransomware, including significant
  financial losses and disruptions to essential services, and makes 11
  recommendations to improve the situation."
