title: AI Use Cases Department of Agriculture
description: >-
  The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has compiled an inventory of its
  Artificial Intelligence (AI) use cases, in line with Executive Order (EO)
  13960, ""Promoting the Use of Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in the
  Federal Government."" This order mandates federal agencies to catalog their AI
  applications and make this information accessible to other government entities
  and the public. The primary goal is to ensure that the deployment of AI not
  only drives economic growth and enhances the quality of life for all Americans
  but also upholds public trust and safeguards the rights and values of the
  American populace.


  The USDA's AI inventory, updated in May 2023, encompasses both existing and prospective AI applications, aligning with the agency's mission. This initiative reflects the broader commitment to adopting AI in a manner that is responsible, transparent, and aligned with the nation's values and legal frameworks.
