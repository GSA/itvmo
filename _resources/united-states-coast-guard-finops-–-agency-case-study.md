title: United States Coast Guard FinOps – Agency Case Study
description: >-
  The US Coast Guard (USCG) spent the last year standing up a cloud financial
  management program to support its multi-cloud environment, which includes
  Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure. To best manage this cloud
  environment, the USCG set up a Cloud Center of Excellence (CCoE) to meet the
  demands and needs required for mission execution.


  The CCoE began working with the Army Cloud Account Management Optimization (CAMO) team to procure cloud services under their umbrella contract vehicle. Through this relationship, the USCG was introduced to cloud cost management concepts, the FinOps framework, and the Army’s cloud tracking software, which helps identify optimization opportunities.
