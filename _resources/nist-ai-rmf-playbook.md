description: >-
  The AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF) is designed for voluntary adoption
  with the aim of enhancing the capacity to integrate trustworthiness factors
  into the creation, advancement, application, and assessment of AI products,
  services, and systems.


  As a collaborative reference, the AI RMF Playbook was formulated through an open, transparent, and multidisciplinary approach, spanning an 18-month period of development. This endeavor was conducted in cooperation with over 240 participating entities hailing from private industry, academia, civil society, and government. Valuable feedback received throughout the AI RMF's development phase is openly accessible on the NIST website for public commentary. The Playbook is also availible to all through the NIST website.
