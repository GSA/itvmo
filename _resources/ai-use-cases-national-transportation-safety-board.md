title: AI Use Cases National Transportation Safety Board
description: >-
  The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has stated that it does not
  currently utilize any Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems for agency
  operations. This information is part of the AI use case inventory that
  organizations are compiling in response to Executive Order 13960: Promoting
  the Use of Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in the Federal Government.


  While the NTSB does not have AI use cases to report at this time, the agency's transparency in this matter aligns with the broader goal of the executive order to ensure that the deployment of AI in federal agencies is transparent, responsible, and aligned with public interest.
