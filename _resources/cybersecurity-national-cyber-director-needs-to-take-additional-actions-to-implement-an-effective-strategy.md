title: "Cybersecurity: National Cyber Director Needs to Take Additional Actions
  to Implement an Effective Strategy"
description: >-
  This U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) report, evaluates the
  National Cybersecurity Strategy and its implementation plan, led by the Office
  of the National Cyber Director (ONCD). The strategy aims to protect federal
  information systems and the nation's critical infrastructure against
  cyberattacks. While the strategy and plan establish a solid foundation, the
  GAO identifies gaps in detailing how to consistently and effectively implement
  the strategy across the government. The report highlights the need for the
  ONCD to incorporate more specific performance measures and estimate
  implementation costs to enhance the strategy's execution.


  The strategy and plan address four of six desirable characteristics identified by the GAO but only partially meet the remaining two. The gaps include a lack of outcome-oriented performance measures and detailed resource and cost estimates for implementation initiatives. The GAO emphasizes that addressing these shortcomings is crucial for understanding plan outcomes and managing the funding of activities effectively. The report concludes with two recommendations for the ONCD: to develop outcome-oriented performance measures and to estimate the costs of implementation activities. While the ONCD agrees with the first recommendation, it disagrees with the second, highlighting a divergence in views on the strategy's execution.
