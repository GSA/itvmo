title: White House Roundtable on Protecting Our Nationâ€™s Data and Networks from
  Future Cybersecurity Threats
description: In January, the White House hosted a roundtable with leaders from
  government, industry, and academia to address the challenges and opportunities
  presented by quantum computing, as outlined in National Security Memorandum 10
  (NSM-10) and the Quantum Computing Cybersecurity Preparedness Act of 2022. The
  discussion focused on the potential of quantum computers to significantly
  advance processing capabilities, while also posing risks to encryption and
  cybersecurity. Officials emphasized the importance of strong encryption and
  the implementation of zero trust defenses to protect critical government
  services and infrastructure. The roundtable highlighted the need for a
  whole-of-government approach to maintain a competitive edge in quantum
  computing and ensure the nation's cyber defenses remain resilient against the
  emerging threats posed by quantum capabilities. Collaboration with
  stakeholders from industry and academia was deemed essential for informing
  migration efforts to post-quantum cryptography (PQC), consistent with
  legislative and policy directives.
