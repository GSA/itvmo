title: AI Use Cases U.S. Department of Personnel Management
description: >-
  The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has developed an inventory of
  Artificial Intelligence (AI) use cases in response to Executive Order 13960,
  ""Promoting the Use of Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in the Federal
  Government."" This order mandates federal agencies to catalog their
  non-classified and non-sensitive AI applications and make this information
  accessible to the public and other government entities, as feasible.


  The OPM's Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) has compiled this inventory, which not only adheres to the requirements of the executive order but also aims to enhance public understanding of the agency's AI initiatives. The inventory includes both current and planned AI use cases, reflecting OPM's commitment to leveraging AI technology to improve its operations and services.


  For those interested in exploring the specific AI use cases within OPM, the 2023 OPM Artificial Intelligence Inventory is available as an Excel file. This initiative underscores OPM's dedication to transparently integrating AI into its processes, ensuring that these technologies are used responsibly and effectively.
