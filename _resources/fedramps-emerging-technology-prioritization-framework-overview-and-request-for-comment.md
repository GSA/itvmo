title: FedRAMP's Emerging Technology Prioritization Framework - Overview and
  Request for Comment
description: The FedRAMP Emerging Technology Prioritization Framework,
  introduced in response to Executive Order 14110, aims to guide the safe and
  responsible development and use of AI within the federal government. This
  framework outlines how FedRAMP will prioritize Cloud Service Offerings (CSOs)
  that provide emerging technologies, starting with generative AI, to enhance
  federal agencies' mission effectiveness. The initial focus will be on large
  language models (LLMs) for chat interfaces, code-generation tools, and
  prompt-based image generators. The framework integrates into existing FedRAMP
  authorization processes without adding new pathways, maintaining rigorous
  standards. The General Services Administration (GSA) seeks public feedback on
  the draft to ensure it meets stakeholder needs and aligns with the executive
  order's goals.
