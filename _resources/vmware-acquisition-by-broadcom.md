title: VMWare acquisition by Broadcom
description: "Broadcom's acquisition of VMware introduced several changes,
  including a shift to subscription-based licensing, product bundling, and an
  overhaul of the partner network. Perpetual licenses are no longer offered,
  with products consolidated into three bundles: VMware Cloud Foundation, VMware
  vSphere Foundation, and VMware Add-on Services. Agencies face challenges
  adapting to the new model, with increased costs and less flexibility but
  additional embedded value. Alternatives to VMware are being explored, though
  migration is technically complex. Agencies are advised to rightsize their
  environments, evaluate multi-year contracts for discounts, and plan budgets to
  accommodate escalating costs."
