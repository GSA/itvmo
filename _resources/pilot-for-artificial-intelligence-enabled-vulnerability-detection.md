title: Pilot for Artificial Intelligence Enabled Vulnerability Detection
description: The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)
  conducted a pilot program to evaluate the effectiveness of AI-enabled tools
  for vulnerability detection in federal networks. The pilot found that AI is
  best used to enhance, not replace, existing detection tools, though it
  requires significant time for analysts to adapt. Some AI tools were found to
  be unpredictable and challenging to troubleshoot. CISA will continue
  monitoring and testing AI tools to ensure their detection capabilities remain
  cutting-edge.
