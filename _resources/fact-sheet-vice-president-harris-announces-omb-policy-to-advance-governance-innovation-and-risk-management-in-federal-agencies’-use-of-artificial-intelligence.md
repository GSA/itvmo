title: "FACT SHEET: Vice President Harris Announces OMB Policy to Advance
  Governance, Innovation, and Risk Management in Federal Agenciesâ€™ Use of
  Artificial Intelligence"
description: Vice President Kamala Harris announced the White House Office of
  Management and Budget (OMB)'s first government-wide policy to address the
  risks and harness the benefits of artificial intelligence (AI), fulfilling a
  key aspect of President Biden's Executive Order on AI. This policy mandates
  federal agencies to implement safeguards by December 1, 2024, for AI
  applications that could impact Americans' rights or safety, covering areas
  such as health, education, employment, and housing. These safeguards aim to
  ensure responsible AI use, including algorithmic fairness, transparency, and
  human oversight in critical decision-making processes. Additionally, the
  policy encourages federal agencies to consult with employee unions and adopt
  principles to mitigate AI's potential harms to workers. It also outlines
  measures for risk management in AI procurement, enhancing transparency in AI
  use, promoting responsible AI innovation, and expanding the AI workforce
  within the federal government. This initiative represents a significant step
  towards establishing the U.S. government as a global model for the safe and
  ethical use of AI.
