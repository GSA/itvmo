title: Secure Cloud Business Applications (SCuBA) Project
description: The Secure Cloud Business Applications (SCuBA) project, initiated
  by the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), aims to bolster
  the security of cloud business applications and protect federal information
  within these environments. SCuBA focuses on providing guidance and
  capabilities to secure cloud environments used by Federal Civilian Executive
  Branch (FCEB) agencies, ensuring consistent, modern, and manageable security
  configurations. CISA actively seeks public feedback to refine these frameworks
  and ensure they effectively address cybersecurity and visibility gaps in
  cloud-based business applications.
