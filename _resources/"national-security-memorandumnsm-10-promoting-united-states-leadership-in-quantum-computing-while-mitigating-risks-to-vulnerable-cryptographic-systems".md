description: "The US aims to expand its quantum computing capabilities while mitigating risks to data security. The memo directs agencies to support quantum R&D and workforce development to maintain US leadership. Agencies must inventory systems vulnerable to quantum computers within 180 days and develop encryption modernization plans. This aims to protect sensitive data as quantum computing advances. A Quantum Cryptography and Post-Quantum Cryptography Technical Evaluation Group will be established. This interagency group will coordinate technical strategies for cryptographic modernization across government."
