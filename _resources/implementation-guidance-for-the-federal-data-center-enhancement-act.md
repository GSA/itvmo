title: Implementation Guidance for the Federal Data Center Enhancement Act
description: The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has issued Memorandum
  M-25-03 to guide federal agencies in enhancing the reliability and resiliency
  of their data centers, in line with the Federal Data Center Enhancement Act of
  2023. This guidance emphasizes the importance of secure and highly available
  computing infrastructure, especially as agencies increasingly rely on digital
  services and artificial intelligence. It supersedes the previous Federal Data
  Center Consolidation Initiative, focusing now on cybersecurity, resiliency,
  and availability standards. Agencies are directed to centralize data center
  investment decisions and apply this guidance to both agency-operated and
  contractor-operated data centers, excluding facilities solely supporting
  commercial cloud services.
