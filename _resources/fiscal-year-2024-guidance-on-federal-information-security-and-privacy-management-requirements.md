title: Fiscal Year 2024 Guidance on Federal Information Security and Privacy
  Management Requirements
description: >-
  The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has been leveraging artificial
  intelligence (AI) to enhance various mission areas for several years,
  witnessing the transformative impact of this technology daily. From the
  application of machine learning models in customs and border protection, which
  intelligently predict the need for additional inspections among the myriad
  vehicles, passengers, and cargo shipments crossing borders each day, to the
  strategic allocation of inspection resources by Homeland Security
  Investigations, AI's role is profound and multi-faceted.


  Recognizing the potential of AI, the Department has intensified its commitment to integrating this technology throughout its operations responsibly. In a significant move to consolidate these efforts, Secretary Mayorkas, in April 2023, inaugurated the Department's Artificial Intelligence Task Force under the leadership of the Secretary for Science and Technology. The commitment was further solidified in September 2023 with the appointment of Eric Hysen as the Department's inaugural Chief AI Officer. This strategic positioning marks a pivotal step in propelling the Department's endeavors in the realm of AI, ensuring a focused and robust integration of AI technologies in enhancing national security and operational efficiency.
