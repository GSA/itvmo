title: Cloud Operations Best Practices & Resources Guide
description: "GSA's guide supports a federal agency’s journey to optimize its
  cloud operations. Whether purchasing new cloud services, migrating
  applications, or simply managing your current IT investments, your agency’s
  ability to manage the cost, capability, security and quality of your cloud
  impacts how well it serves its mission and its stewardship of taxpayer
  dollars. The guide is not a how-to or training document; it is not meant to be
  read cover to cover. Rather, it is organized to allow readers to quickly find
  the relevant best practices, useful resources, and agency templates on a
  specific topic of interest. "
