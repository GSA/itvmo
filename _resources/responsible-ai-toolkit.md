title: Responsible AI Toolkit
description: The Responsible AI (RAI) Toolkit, developed by the Chief Digital
  and Artificial Intelligence Office (CDAO), is designed to align AI projects
  with the Department of Defense's (DoD) AI Ethical Principles and best
  practices. It offers a user-friendly interface for navigating through AI
  product life cycles, incorporating tailorable assessments, tools, and
  artifacts. The Toolkit, based on principles like modularity, alignment with
  the RASCI matrix, and holistic approach, integrates the DoD AI Ethical
  Principles, providing resources for AI system evaluation and improvement. It
  also includes a list of tools for risk mitigation and development support. The
  SHIELD assessment, central to the Toolkit, guides users in risk identification
  and management. The Toolkit, considered a living document, is set to evolve
  with new capabilities and improvements over time.
