title: Advancing the Responsible Acquisition of Artificial Intelligence in Government
description: The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the Federal Government
  presents tremendous opportunity for modernizing agency operations and
  improving the delivery of government services to the public, provided that the
  risks presented by the use of AI technology are mitigated. Realizing this goal
  involves recognizing that AI poses novel types of risk, and proactively
  integrating considerations for AI risk management into agency acquisition
  planning. This memorandum builds on previous efforts to harness the power and
  utility of AI in service of agency missions while protecting the public from
  potential risks or harms.
