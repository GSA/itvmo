title: OMB Releases Digital Accessibility Guidance to Ensure All Americans Have
  Ability to Access Critical Government Resources
description: The White House's Office of Management and Budget has released new
  digital accessibility guidance to ensure all Americans, including those with
  disabilities, can access critical government resources. This initiative is a
  response to the fact that nearly half of the most popular federal government
  websites were not fully accessible. The guidance includes testing electronic
  content for accessibility before publishing, establishing digital
  accessibility programs and policies, ensuring procurement of accessible
  products and services, regularly monitoring and remediating accessibility
  issues, and promoting a culture of digital accessibility within agencies. This
  comprehensive approach aims to provide universally accessible digital
  experiences to the public.
