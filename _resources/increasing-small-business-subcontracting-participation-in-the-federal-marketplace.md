title: " Increasing Small Business Subcontracting Participation in the Federal
  Marketplace"
description: >-
  Building supply chain resilience in the federal marketplace requires agencies
  to work

  aggressively with their prime contractors to promote meaningful small business subcontracting

  opportunities. Subcontracting is the primary gateway into the federal marketplace â€“ helping

  companies to become acclimated to federal missions and buying practices, and agencies to

  become familiar with the talents of small businesses that perform important functions within

  supply chains and may wish to compete as prime contractors in the future.
