title: FedRAMP Modernization Overview
description: >-
  Provides an overview of the FedRAMP Modernization initiative, detailing the
  steps being taken to upgrade technology and processes to better meet the
  future needs of FedRAMP’s stakeholders. The modernization efforts are in
  response to legislation codifying FedRAMP and align with OMB budget’s draft
  memo on modernizing FedRAMP. The goal is to improve federal cloud
  cybersecurity by reducing the time, cost, and effort for initial assessments
  of commercial cloud service offerings (CSOs), improving customer experience,
  increasing the quality and accuracy of security artifacts through
  standardization, and refining the continuous monitoring program.


  Efforts are being made to evaluate and optimize security assessment and monitoring processes to reduce authorization timelines and costs. This includes addressing backlogs and streamlining the flow of security packages. The focus is on strengthening collaboration and engagement with the stakeholder community (agencies and commercial partners) to meet their needs and achieve program goals. The modernization efforts aim to make it easier for stakeholders to create, submit, and process assessment and continuous monitoring documentation.
