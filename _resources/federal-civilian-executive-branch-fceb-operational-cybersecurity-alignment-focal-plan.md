title: Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) Operational Cybersecurity
  Alignment (FOCAL) Plan
description: >-
  As the operational lead for federal cybersecurity, CISA uses the FOCAL Plan to
  guide coordinated support and services to agencies, drive progress on a
  targeted set of priorities, and align collective operational defense
  capabilities. The end result is reducing the risk to more than 100 FCEB
  agencies. 


  CISA developed this plan in collaboration with FCEB agencies to provide standard, essential components of enterprise operational cybersecurity and align collective operational defense capabilities across the federal enterprise. 


  The FOCAL Plan is not intended to provide a comprehensive or exhaustive list that an agency or CISA must accomplish. Rather, it is designed to focus resources on actions that substantively advance operational cybersecurity improvements and alignment goals.
