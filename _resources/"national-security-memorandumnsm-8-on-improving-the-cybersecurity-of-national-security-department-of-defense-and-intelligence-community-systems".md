This aims to protect national security systems from sophisticated cyber threats. The National Security Advisor will convene an interagency process to establish performance targets and accountability measures for cybersecurity. This aims to drive progress on modernization efforts. Agencies must adopt multi-factor authentication, encryption for data at rest and in transit, and enhanced logging and monitoring. These are core technical measures to improve cybersecurity across sensitive systems."
