title: M-24-10 Memorandum For The Heads Of Executive Departments And Agencies
description: "The memorandum from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB),
  titled: Advancing Governance, Innovation, and Risk Management for Agency Use
  of Artificial Intelligence (AI), outlines the U.S. government's approach to
  harnessing AI's potential while addressing its risks. Issued on March 28,
  2024, it aligns with the AI in Government Act of 2020, the Advancing American
  AI Act, and Executive Order 14110, emphasizing the need for responsible AI use
  within federal agencies. Key directives include the establishment of AI
  governance frameworks, the appointment of Chief AI Officers (CAIOs) within 60
  days, and the development of agency-specific AI strategies. Agencies are
  tasked with managing AI risks, especially those impacting public rights and
  safety, through minimum risk management practices. Additionally, the memo
  encourages the sharing and reuse of AI models, code, and data to foster
  innovation, while also addressing the challenges posed by generative AI. This
  governance initiative aims to ensure that AI technologies are used in a manner
  that is safe, secure, and trustworthy, reflecting a commitment to both
  innovation and ethical responsibility."
