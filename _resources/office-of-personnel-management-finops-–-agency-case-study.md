title: Office of Personnel Management FinOps – Agency Case Study
description: >-
  The United States Office of Personnel Management (OPM) established a FinOps
  program in 2021 with the existing CCOE (Cloud Center of Excellence) dedicated
  to maturing OPM’s cloud management activities and aligning them to the FinOps
  Foundation maturity model. The mission of the FinOps team is tied directly to
  OPM’s Cloud First strategy and helped establish a cross-functional team
  responsible for ensuring more financial control and predictability.


  OPM has embraced FinOps and is a thought leader with the FinOps Foundation. OPM is a member of the FinOps Foundation Governing Board and has led the public sector working group along with other government employees and industry professionals. The group is tasked with developing processes and procedures to help government agencies implement FinOps.
