title: Department Of Homeland Security Artificial Intelligence Roadmap 2024
description: >-
  The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is actively incorporating artificial
  intelligence (AI) into its operations to enhance national security and
  efficiency across various domains. AI's role in DHS's mission has expanded
  significantly, with the department leveraging this technology for over a
  decade. Initially, AI was used for tasks requiring human intelligence, but it
  now includes systems capable of reasoning, inference, and learning. The
  sophistication of AI systems has notably increased, especially in recent
  years, making them more accessible through internet-based interfaces and
  integrated software.


  DHS's AI applications span across border security, cybersecurity, immigration, trade, transportation safety, and workforce productivity. The department has been pioneering in using machine learning (ML) technologies since 2015, starting with identity verification tasks. Currently, DHS has documented 41 different AI use cases, with plans to expand this inventory as AI usage grows.
