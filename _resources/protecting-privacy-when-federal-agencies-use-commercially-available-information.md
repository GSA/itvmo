title: Protecting Privacy When Federal Agencies Use Commercially Available Information
description: As Federal agencies increasingly use artificial intelligence (AI)
  in executing their various missions, how they collect, use, and maintain the
  information that powers that technology merits renewed attention. Along with
  the potential benefits of using such technology, there are potential risks.
  Executive Order 14110, Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of
  Artificial Intelligence, recognized “privacy risks potentially exacerbated by
  AI—including by AI’s facilitation of the collection or use of information
  about individuals” as one of these potential risks, and it tasked the Office
  of Management and Budget (OMB) with taking certain steps to mitigate them.
