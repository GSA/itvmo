title: "July 2023 Monthly Bulletin: Growing Small Business via IT Category Management"
description: "The federal government spent over $72B on IT in FY
22. Of this $72B, 38% was spent on small businesses
exceeding the category's annual key performance
indicator (KPI) of 37.5%. This percentage has
increased each of the last three (3) years.  Further,
these dollars were awarded to ~8,500 different small
businesses primes, ~3,500 of which were small
disadvantaged businesses (SDBs).  However, the
number of small business primes has slid down more
than 20% since just FY20.  As part of this year's
strategic plan, the Governmentwide IT Category
Manager is prioritizing mechanisms to rebound and
grow this small business supply base.
