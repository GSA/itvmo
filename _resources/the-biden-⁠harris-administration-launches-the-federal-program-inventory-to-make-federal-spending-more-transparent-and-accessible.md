title: The Biden-⁠Harris Administration Launches the Federal Program Inventory
  to Make Federal Spending More Transparent and Accessible
description: >-
  The Biden-Harris Administration, through the Office of Management and Budget
  (OMB), has launched the Federal Program Inventory (FPI), a new tool aimed at
  enhancing transparency and accessibility of federal spending. The FPI is a
  comprehensive, searchable database that provides detailed information on
  federal programs offering grants, loans, or direct payments to various
  beneficiaries, including individuals, governments, firms, and organizations.
  This initiative is part of the administration's commitment to improve
  government transparency and ensure the effective use of taxpayer funds,
  fulfilling Congressional mandates for public access to a federal program
  inventory.


  The FPI allows users to explore federal programs based on objectives, eligibility, and spending data. It offers a customizable search feature to filter programs by categories, agencies, assistance types, and applicant eligibility, covering over 100 sub-categories. Leveraging data from SAM.gov and USASpending.gov, the FPI facilitates easy access to program-specific spending details, award recipients, and grant opportunities. OMB invites feedback on the FPI to enhance its functionality in future releases, marking a significant step towards a more transparent, equitable, and accountable government.
