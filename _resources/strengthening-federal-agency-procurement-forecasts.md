title: Strengthening Federal Agency Procurement Forecasts
description: >-
  The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) continues to work closely with
  agencies to buy as

  an organized entity to get better contract outcomes and to improve the resilience of the federal

  marketplace. Better procurement forecasts are an important part of constructive engagement with

  industry that helps contribute to effective, responsible, and efficient execution of federal procurements.

  Consistent with these goals, this guidance provides direction to strengthen procurement forecasts by

  improving the quality of forecast content, the timeliness of forecast information, and vendor access to

  agency forecast information through a centralized point that is phased in over the next 18 months. These

  priorities have been informed by a public crowdsourcing campaign conducted by the Office of Federal

  Procurement Policy (OFPP) that engaged hundreds of small and large businesses across the country in a

  collaborative exercise to better understand vendor needs.
