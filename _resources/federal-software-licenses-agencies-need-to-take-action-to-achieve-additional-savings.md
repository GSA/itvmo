title: "Federal Software Licenses: Agencies Need to Take Action to Achieve
  Additional Savings"
description: Annually, the U.S. federal government allocates over $100 billion
  to IT and cybersecurity initiatives, a significant portion of which is
  dedicated to acquiring software licenses. With thousands of these licenses
  procured from various vendors each year, the Government Accountability Office
  (GAO) was tasked to scrutinize the procurement of these software licenses by
  federal agencies. To achieve this, the GAO examined self-reported data from
  agencies under the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990, focusing on their
  five most used and costliest software licenses. These were then ranked based
  on the frequency of specific vendors and products mentioned across the
  government. Furthermore, the GAO conducted a detailed review of nine agencies,
  chosen based on their IT budget sizes. This review involved comparing the
  agencies' most used licenses against established federal guidelines and
  conducting interviews with officials from all 24 agencies. As a result, the
  GAO has put forward 18 recommendations for nine agencies, urging them to
  meticulously track software license usage and align their inventories with the
  licenses purchased.
