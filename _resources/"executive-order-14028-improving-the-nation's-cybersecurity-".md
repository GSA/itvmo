title: "E.O. 14028, Improving the Nationâ€™s Cybersecurity"
description: "Agencies must accelerate efforts to implement zero trust architecture and enhanced cybersecurity measures like multi-factor authentication and encryption. This aims to protect sensitive systems from sophisticated threats.
There will be increased information sharing and coordination between agencies for cyber incident response. This includes adopting common response playbooks. Improved logging, data retention, and investigative capabilities will be prioritized. This aims to enable rapid detection, investigation, and remediation of cyber incidents across agencies. Agencies will be required to conduct an assessment of their most sensitive data and systems that are at high risk. This will inform plans for improving protections."
