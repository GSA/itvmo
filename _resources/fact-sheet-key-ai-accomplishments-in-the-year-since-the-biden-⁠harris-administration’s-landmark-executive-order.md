  Administration’s Landmark Executive Order"
description: >-
  One year ago, President Biden issued a landmark Executive Order to ensure that
  America leads the way in seizing the promise and managing the risks of
  artificial intelligence (AI). The Executive Order directed sweeping actions to
  manage AI’s safety and security risks, protect Americans’ privacy, advance
  equity and civil rights, stand up for consumers and workers, promote
  innovation and competition, advance American leadership around the world, and
  more.


  Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing that Federal agencies have completed on schedule each action that the Executive Order tasked for this past year—more than one hundred in all. Below are some of the Administration’s most significant accomplishments on managing AI’s risks and seizing its promise in the year since President Biden signed his Executive Order.
