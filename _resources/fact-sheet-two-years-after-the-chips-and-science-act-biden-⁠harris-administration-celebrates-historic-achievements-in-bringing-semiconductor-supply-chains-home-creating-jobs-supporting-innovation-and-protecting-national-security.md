title: "FACT SHEET: Two Years after the CHIPS and Science Act, Biden-⁠Harris
  Administration Celebrates Historic Achievements in Bringing Semiconductor
  Supply Chains Home, Creating Jobs, Supporting Innovation, and Protecting
  National Security"
description: "Two years ago, President Biden signed into law the CHIPS and
  Science Act (CHIPS), aimed at reestablishing United States’ leadership in
  semiconductor manufacturing, shoring up global supply chains, and
  strengthening national and economic security. America invented the
  semiconductor, and used to produce nearly 40 percent of the world’s chips, but
  today, we produce only about 10 percent of global supply—and none of the most
  advanced chips. The CHIPS and Science Act aimed to change that by investing
  nearly $53 billion in U.S. semiconductor manufacturing, research and
  development, and workforce.  "
