title: Artificial Intelligence and Its Potential Effects on the Economy and the
  Federal Budget
description: The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released a report on December
  20, 2024, analyzing how artificial intelligence (AI) could impact the U.S.
  economy and federal budget. The report suggests that AI adoption may boost
  economic growth by enhancing productivity and enabling new products and
  services. However, it also notes potential disruptions in employment and wage
  structures, leading to shifts in income distribution. These economic changes
  could influence federal revenues and expenditures, though the exact effects
  remain uncertain. Additionally, the government's use of AI might improve
  operational efficiency and revenue collection but could also require
  significant initial investments. The CBO emphasizes the unpredictability of
  AI's future trajectory and its complex implications for economic and budgetary
  outcomes.
