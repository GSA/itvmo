description: >-
  The Department of Energy (DOE) has diligently compiled a catalog of Artificial
  Intelligence (AI) utilization scenarios, in strict accordance with the
  directives set forth in Executive Order (EO) 13960, titled ""Promoting the Use
  of Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in the Federal Government."" This
  catalog represents a vital component of the DOE's unwavering commitment to
  harnessing AI for the advancement of the United States' energy infrastructure
  and related services.


  This dataset serves as a systematic mechanism through which federal agencies can systematically document their AI deployments, thereby ensuring transparency and instilling public confidence in the responsible use of these technological innovations. The structured approach employed guarantees that each AI application is comprehensively documented, providing a lucid understanding of the AI's purpose, nature, and development stage within the purview of the DOE.
